### Colocation

#### Solution Architecture

HTX swap API colocation solution is built on AWS infrastructure. Client will
connect via AWS “PrivateLink” to access HTX’s services directly through fast AWS
connection without being routed to public networks.

#### Performance Improvement

The network delay of colocation solution is estimated to be 10ms to 50ms faster
than the ordinary connection. This improvement estimated should be used as a
guidance only as the actual improvement depends on many factors.

#### Eligibility

Colocation is only available to higher tier market makers. To check if your
account is eligible please talk to your dedicated account manager.

### Risk Mechanism

#### Partial Liquidation

Margin ratio is an indicator to estimate the risk of users’assets. When the
margin ratio is less than or equal to 0%, liquidation will be triggered.

It is recommended that you pay close attention to margin ratio changes, so as to
avoid your positions from liquidation.

HTX contracts implement a partial liquidation mechanism, in which the system
will lower the corresponding tier of an adjustment factor to avoid your
positions from being liquidated at one time.

More detail to see:
[Partial Liquidation](https://www.huobi.com/support/en-us/detail/900001325083)

#### Insurance Funds and Clawback Mechanism

Insurance funds are designed to cover the losses from forced liquidation.

In a fluctuating market, users’ positions may be liquidated. When the order
cannot be filled at the takeover price, resulting in huge losses that are
greater than the part insurance funds can undertake, the platform will implement
the “clawback” mechanism. Each profitable account in the current period
compensates the over loss of liquidation according to its profit ratio.

[Partial Liquidation](https://www.huobi.com/support/en-us/detail/900001325083)

#### Tiered Adjustment Factor

The adjustment factor is designed to prevent users from extended margin call
loss. HTX Contracts use a tiered adjustment factor mechanism, which supports up
to five tiers based on the position amount.

For contracts with different expirations under the different account modes, they
are separately calculated. The larger the use’s net positions, the higher the
tier, and the greater the risk.

### Matching Mechanism

1.  Matching System: Order accepted by the Order System will enter the Matching
    System. Once orders are matched/filled, the settlement service will be
    executed and the matching result will be returned to the Order System;
    otherwise, the unfilled orders will go into the order book for matching.
2.  Price Priority: Higher-priced buy orders have priority over lower-priced buy
    orders; the reverse is true, lower-priced sell orders have priority over
    higher-priced sell orders.
3.  Time Priority: Buy orders at the same price are executed according to the
    time of entry to the Server.
4.  When the highest bid price is the same as the lowest ask price of the order
    book, this price is what we call transaction price.
5.  When the bid price is higher than the lowest ask price of the order book up
    to the minute, the lowest ask price will be the transaction price.
6.  When the ask price is lower than the highest bid price of the order book up
    to the minute, the highest bid price will be the transaction price.

### Signature Authentication & Verification

#### Signature Guide

Considering that API requests may get tampered in the process of transmission,
to keep the transmission secure, you have to use your API Key to do Signature
Authentication for all private interface except for public interface (used for
acuqiring basic information and market data), in this way to verify whether the
parameters/ parameter value get tampered or not in the process of transmission

A legitimate request consists of following parts：

- Request address of method, i.e. visit server address--api.hbdm.com, e.g.:
  api.hbdm.com/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_order
- API Access Key ID (AccessKeyId): Access Key of the API Key that you apply.
- Method of Signature (SignatureMethod): The first one is for users to use the
  elliptic curve digital signature algorithm, using Ed25519. ‌The second,
  hash-based protocol for user-computed signatures, uses HmacSHA256.
- Ed25519 introduction: It is a high-performance digital signature algorithm
  that provides fast signature verification and generation while having high
  security.
- Signature Version (SignatureVersion): It adopts version 2 in terms of
  Signature Version.
- Timestamp (Timestamp): The time when you send the request (UTC time zone) :
  (UTC time zone) : (UTC time zone), e.g.: 2017-05-11T16:22:06
- Must-fill parameters & optional parameters: For each method, there are a group
  of must-fill parameters and optional parameters used to address the API
  request, which can be found in the illustration of each method as well as
  their meaning. Please note that, in terms of "Get" requests, it needs to do
  Signature calculation for all the original parameters in each method ; In
  terms of "Post" requests, no need to do Signature calculation for the original
  parameters in each method, which means only four parameters need to do
  Signature calculation in "Post" requests, i.e. AccessKeyId, SignatureMethod,
  SignatureVersion, Timestamp with other parameters placed in "body".
- Signature: The result of Signature calculation which is used to verify if
  signature is valid and not tampered.

#### Create API Key

[You could create API Key at](https://www.hbg.com/zh-cn/apikey/)

API Key consists of the following two parts.

- "Access Key", the Key used to visit API.
- "Secret Key", the Key used to do Signature authentication and verification
  (visible during application period).

When create API Key, users could bind IP address, as the validity of unbond IP
address is only 90 days.

API Key has operation authorization of trading, borrowing, deposit and
withdrawal etc..

Both Access Key and Secret Key are closely related with account security, please
do not disclose them to others for any reasons anytime.

#### Ed25519 Steps for Signature

Normative request for Signature calculation Different contents will get totally
different results when use HMAC to calculate Signature, therefore, please
normalize the requests before doing Signature calculation. Take the request of
inquering order details as an example:

query details of one order

`[https://api.hbdm.com/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_order](https://api.hbdm.com/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_order)?`

`AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx`

`&SignatureMethod=Ed25519`

`&SignatureVersion=2`

`&Timestamp=2017-05-11T15:19:30`

#### 1\. Request methods (GET/POST): add line breaker "\\n".

`POST\n`

#### 2\. Text the visit address in lowercase, adding line breake "\\n"

`[api.hbdm.com](http://api.hbdm.com)\n`

#### 3\. Visit the path of methods, adding line breaker "\\n"

`/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_order\n`

#### 4\. Rank the parameter names according to the sequence of ASCII codes, for example, below is the parameters in original sequence and the new sequence:

`AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx`

`SignatureMethod=Ed25519`

`SignatureVersion=2`

`Timestamp=2017-05-11T15%3A19%3A30`

Use UTF-8 to encode when it has already been encoded by URI with hexadecimals in
Uppercase, e.g., ":" wiil be encoded to "%3A" while space to "%20".Timestamp
should be written in the form of YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss and encoded with URI.

#### 5\. After ranking

`AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx`

`SignatureMethod=Ed25519`

`SignatureVersion=2`

`Timestamp=2017-05-11T15%3A19%3A30`

#### 6\. Following the sequence above, link parameters with "&"

`AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx&SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256&SignatureVersion=2&Timestamp=2017-05-11T15%3A19%3A30`

#### 7\. Form the final character strings that need to do Signature calculation as following:

`POST\n`

`[api.hbdm.com](http://api.hbdm.com)\n`

`/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_order\n`

`AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx&SignatureMethod=Ed25519&SignatureVersion=2&Timestamp=2017-05-11T15%3A19%3A30`

#### 8\. Use the "request character strings" formed in the last step and your Secret Key to create a digital Signature.

`4F65x5A2bLyMWVQj3Aqp+B4w+ivaA7n5Oi2SuYtCJ9o=`

1.  Use the request string obtained in the previous step to generate the private
    key of Ed25519 and add it to generate a signature.
2.  Encode the generated signature with base-64, and the resulting value is used
    as the digital signature of this interface call.

#### 9\. Add the digital Signature into the parameters of request path.

The final request sent to Server via API should be like:

`[https://api.hbdm.com/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_order?AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx&order-id=1234567890&SignatureMethod=Ed25519&SignatureVersion=2&Timestamp=2017-05-11T15%3A19%3A30&Signature=4F65x5A2bLyMWVQj3Aqp%2BB4w%2BivaA7n5Oi2SuYtCJ9o%3D](https://api.hbdm.com/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_order?AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx&order-id=1234567890&SignatureMethod=Ed25519&SignatureVersion=2&Timestamp=2017-05-11T15%3A19%3A30&Signature=4F65x5A2bLyMWVQj3Aqp%2BB4w%2BivaA7n5Oi2SuYtCJ9o%3D)`

1.  Add all the must authentication parameters into the parameters of request
    path;
2.  Add the digital Signature encoded with URL code into the path parameters
    with the parameter name of "Signature".

#### HmacSHA256 Steps for Signature

Normative request for Signature calculation Different contents will get totally
different results when use HMAC to calculate Signature, therefore, please
normalize the requests before doing Signature calculation. Take the request of
inquering order details as an example:

query details of one order

`[https://api.hbdm.com/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_order](https://api.hbdm.com/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_order)?`

`AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx`

`&SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256`

`&SignatureVersion=2`

`&Timestamp=2017-05-11T15:19:30`

#### 1\. Request methods (GET/POST): add line breaker "\\n".

`POST\n`

#### 2\. Text the visit address in lowercase, adding line breake "\\n"

`[api.hbdm.com](http://api.hbdm.com)\n`

#### 3\. Visit the path of methods, adding line breaker "\\n"

`/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_order\n`

#### 4\. Rank the parameter names according to the sequence of ASCII codes, for example, below is the parameters in original sequence and the new sequence:

`AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx`

`SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256`

`SignatureVersion=2`

`Timestamp=2017-05-11T15%3A19%3A30`

Use UTF-8 to encode when it has already been encoded by URI with hexadecimals in
Uppercase, e.g., ":" wiil be encoded to "%3A" while space to "%20".Timestamp
should be written in the form of YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss and encoded with URI.

#### 5\. After ranking

`AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx`

`SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256`

`SignatureVersion=2`

`Timestamp=2017-05-11T15%3A19%3A30`

#### 6\. Following the sequence above, link parameters with "&"

`AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx&SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256&SignatureVersion=2&Timestamp=2017-05-11T15%3A19%3A30`

#### 7\. Form the final character strings that need to do Signature calculation as following:

`POST\n`

`[api.hbdm.com](http://api.hbdm.com)\n`

`/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_order\n`

`AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx&SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256&SignatureVersion=2&Timestamp=2017-05-11T15%3A19%3A30`

#### 8\. Use the "request character strings" formed in the last step and your Secret Key to create a digital Signature.

`4F65x5A2bLyMWVQj3Aqp+B4w+ivaA7n5Oi2SuYtCJ9o=`

1.  Take the request character string formed in the last step and API Secret Key
    as two parameters, encoding them with the Hash Function HmacSHA256 to get
    corresponding Hash value.
2.  Encoding the Hash value with base-64 code, the result will be the digital
    Signature of this request.

#### 9\. Add the digital Signature into the parameters of request path.

The final request sent to Server via API should be like:

`[https://api.hbdm.com/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_order?AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx&order-id=1234567890&SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256&SignatureVersion=2&Timestamp=2017-05-11T15%3A19%3A30&Signature=4F65x5A2bLyMWVQj3Aqp%2BB4w%2BivaA7n5Oi2SuYtCJ9o%3D](https://api.hbdm.com/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_order?AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx&order-id=1234567890&SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256&SignatureVersion=2&Timestamp=2017-05-11T15%3A19%3A30&Signature=4F65x5A2bLyMWVQj3Aqp%2BB4w%2BivaA7n5Oi2SuYtCJ9o%3D)`

1.  Add all the must authentication parameters into the parameters of request
    path;
2.  Add the digital Signature encoded with URL code into the path parameters
    with the parameter name of "Signature".

### API Rate Limit Illustration

Future, Coin Margined Swap,Option Swap and USDT Margined Contracts are using
separate API rate limits.

Please note that, for both public interface and private interface, there are
rate limits, more details are as below:

- Generally, the private interface rate limit of API key is at most 144 times
  every 3 seconds for each UID (Trade Interface: at most 72 times every 3
  seconds. Read Interface: at most 72 times every 3 seconds) (this rate limit is
  shared by all the altcoins contracts delivered by different date).
  [API Interface List](https://docs.huobigroup.com/docs/usdt_swap/v1/en/#api-list)
- For public interface used to get information of index, price limit,
  settlement, delivery, open positions and so on, the rate limit is 240 times
  every 3 second at most for each IP (this 240 times every 3 second public
  interface rate limit is shared by all the requests from that IP of
  non-marketing information, like above).
- For public interface to get market data such as Get Kline data, Get Market
  Data Overview, Get Contract Information,Get market in-depth data, Get premium
  index Kline, Get real-time forecast capital rate kline, Get basis data, Get
  the last Trade of a Contract and so on：

  （1）For restful interfaces, products, (future, coin margined swap, usdt
  margined Contracts)800 times/second for one IP at most

  （2）For websocket: The rate limit for “req” request is 50 times at once. No
  limit for “sub” request as the data will be pushed by sever voluntarily.

- WebSocket, the private order push interface, requires API KEY Verification:

  Each UID can build at most create 30 WS connections for private order push at
  the same time. For each account, contracts of the same underlying coin only
  need to subscribe one WS order push, e.g. users only need to create one WS
  order push connection for BTC Contract which will automatically push orders of
  BTC-USDTcontracts. Please note that the rate limit of WS order push and
  RESTFUL private interface are separated from each other, with no relations.

- Both read and trade interfaces will return the ratelimit info.You can refer to
  the following fields of "header" from api response. E.g.,you will get the
  total Read ratelimit("ratelimit-limit") and the remaining Read
  ratelimit("ratelimit-remaining") when you query the order
  info(/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_account_info) , and you will get the total Trade
  ratelimit("ratelimit-limit") and the remaining Trade
  ratelimit("ratelimit-remaining") when you place an
  order(/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_order)).
  [API Interface List](https://docs.huobigroup.com/docs/usdt_swap/v1/en/#api-list)
- Will response following string for "header" via api

  ratelimit-limit: the upper limit of requests per time, unit: times

  ratelimit-interval: reset interval (reset the number of request), unit: ms

  ratelimit-remaining: the left available request number for this round, unit:
  times

  ratelimit-reset: upper limit of reset time used to reset request number, unit:
  ms

  When API Limitation on Order Cancellation Ratio is triggered,the following
  string for "header" via api will also be returned:

  recovery-time: recovery timestamp, whose unit is millisecond, showing the end
  time of prohibition, or the access retrieval timestamp;

  if you are not in the prohibition period, the field is not included in
  returned header;

### API Limitation on Order Cancellation Ratio

- The system will calculate the order cancellation ratio automatically when the
  total number of orders placed via certain order price types by the API user
  goes equal to or larger than 3,000 within 10 minutes. If the order
  cancellation ratio is greater than 99%, the user will be prohibited for 5
  minutes from placing orders via certain API order price types which will be
  listed below (The response of placing orders will return: 1084 Your contract
  API is disabled, please try again after {0} (GMT+8).).
- A 30-minute API order placement prohibition will be triggered if the user was
  prohibited for 3 times within an hour (The response of placing orders will
  return: 1084 Your contract API is disabled, please try again after {0}
  (GMT+8).). After resuming access, the total number of prohibited times will be
  cleared during the previous period and will not be counted into the total
  prohibited times in the new period.
- Please note that the prohibition from placing orders will cause no effect on
  order cancellation via API as well as order placement and cancellation via
  other terminals. We’ll keep you notified on each prohibition via SMS and
  email.
- Only four API order price types will be prohibited which are Limit order,
  Post_only, FOK and IOC. Please note that you can still use freely other order
  price types during the banned period, such as Lightning Close, BBO, Optimal 5,
  Optimal 10 and Optimal 20, opponent_ioc, lightning_ioc, optimal_5_ioc,
  optimal_10_ioc，optimal_20_ioc，opponent_fok，lightning_fok，optimal_5_fok，optimal_10_fok，optimal_20_fok,etc.
- The response header returned by HTTP request:
  - When placing order by using the four prohibited order price types during the
    prohibition period, the message header returned by interface will include
    the field: "recovery-time: recovery timestamp" whose unit is millisecond,
    showing the end time of prohibition, or the access retrieval timestamp; if
    you are not in the prohibition period, the field is not included in returned
    header;
  - Please note that our system calculates order cancellation ratio according to
    UID and therefore, the master account UID and sub-accounts UIDs will be
    counted separately. The calculation period is 10 min/time(The start time
    starts at 00:00 and the end time is 00:10. Every 10 minutes is a cycle.).
- Definition of Indicators：
  - Order Cancellation Ratio =Total number of invalid cancellation / Total
    number of placed orders (all types of orders placed via API)
  - Total number of placed order: Total number of placed orders refers to all
    orders placed via API which meet these requirements:
  - 1.the order type is placing orders (Order Type = 1),
  - 2.order price types include Limit Order, Post_only, FOK and IOC.
  - 3.order creating time should be within the interval between 3 seconds before
    the start time of the calculation period and the end time of the calculation
    period.
  - Total number of invalid cancellation:Total number of invalid cancellation
    refers to all cancellation orders placed via API which meet the
    requirements.
  - the order type is placing orders (order Type=1),
  - the order price types are Limit Order, post_only, FOK and IOC.
  - the order status is “Orders cancelled” (status=7).
  - order with 0 fulfilled.
  - the interval between order cancellation and placement should be less than or
    equal to 3 seconds.
  - the order cancellation time should be within the calculation period.

- In order to ensure stability and transaction performance of API, please try to
  reduce order cancellation rate and cancellation amount during peak periods to
  avoid frequent triggering of API restriction mechanism.Suggestions of reducing
  order cancellation rate are as below:
  - 1\. Set orders’ price to BBO prices as close as possible;
  - 2\. Prolong the interval properly between each order placement and
    cancellation;
  - 3\. Try to increase your amount for each order and reduce the frequency of
    order;
  - 4\. Try to improve your order fulfillment rate:
  - （1）Please try to use order prices types that help more on order
    fulfillment in preference such as BBO, Optimal 5, Optimal 10, Optimal 20,
    lightning Close, opponent_ioc, lightning_ioc, optimal_5_ioc,
    optimal_10_ioc，optimal_20_ioc，opponent_fok，lightning_fok，optimal_5_fok，optimal_10_fok，optimal_20_fok,
    etc.
  - （2）Try to use best bid/ask price when placing IOC orders, FOK orders and
    Post_only orders.
  - 5\. Please try to extend your request polling cycle when implementing your
    strategy.

### API Best Practice

#### 1\. Query contract history orders interface: /linear-swap-api/v1/swap_hisorders

- To ensure timelines and to reduce latency, users are highly recommended to get
  contract history orders information faster from server memory using interface
  “query contract order information” (URL: /linear-swap-api/v1/swap_order_info).
- For users who use interface “query contract history orders” (URL:
  /linear-swap-api/v1/swap_hisorders), please enter as many query conditions as
  possible (including contract_code, trade_type（recommended to send “0” to
  query all）, type, status, create_date). Besides, try not to enter a big
  integer in parameter “create_date”. You are kindly suggested to query one-day
  data at a time.

#### 2\. Query contract match results interface: /linear-swap-api/v1/swap_matchresults

- To improve query performance and response speed, please enter as many querying
  conditions as possible (including contract_code, trade_type（recommended to
  send “0” to query all）, create_date). Besides, try not to enter a big integer
  in parameter “create_date”. You are kindly suggested to query one-day data at
  a time.

#### 3\. Query contract financial record interface: /linear-swap-api/v1/swap_financial_record

- To improve query performance and response speed, please enter as many querying
  conditions as possible (including symbol, type(recommended to leave it blank
  to query all), create_date). Besides, try not to enter a big integer in
  parameter “create_date”. You are kindly suggested to query one-day data at a
  time.

#### 4\. Query contract order detail interface: /linear-swap-api/v1/swap_order_detail

- When querying orders without parameter(such as the parameter: created_at), the
  query result data may be delayed. It is recommended to pass the two parameters
  of the interface: created_at (order timestamp) and order_type (order type,
  default 1), the database will be directly queried, and the query results data
  will be more timely.
- Querying condition “created_at” uses 13-bit long type time stamp (including
  milliseconds). Querying performance will be improved when accurate time stamps
  are entered.
- For example: the converted time stamp of "2019/10/18 10:26:22"
  is 1571365582123. The returned ts from interface “contract_order” can be used
  as time stamp to query corresponding order. 0 is not allowed in parameter
  “created_at”.

#### 5\. WebSocket subscription to Market Depth data:

- For acquiring market depth data within 150 steps, you are kindly suggested to
  use step0, step1, step2, step3, step4, step5, step14, step15, step16, step17；
- For acquiring market depth data within 20 steps, you are kindly suggested to
  use step6, step7, step8, step9, step10, step11, step12, step13, step18,
  step19；
- Since the large volume of pushing 150 steps data every 100ms, WebSocket
  disconnection may occur frequently if client’s network bandwidth is
  insufficient or the processing is not in time; therefore, we highly recommend
  users using step6, step7, step8, step9, step10, step11, step12, step13,
  step18, step19 to acquire 20 steps data. For instance, subscribing 20 steps
  data.

`{`

`"sub": "market.BTC-USDT.depth.step6",`

`"id": "id5"`

`}`

- We also suggest that you subscribe incremental market depth data.orderbook
  event will be checked every 30ms. If there is no orderbook event, you will not
  receive any orderbook data.you HAVE TO maintain local orderbook data,such as
  updating your local orderbook bids and asks data.You can subscribe 20 or 150
  unmerged data.

`{`

`"sub": "market.BTC-USDT.depth.size_20.high_freq",`

`"data_type":"incremental",`

`"id": "id1"`

`}`

#### 6\. Place order interface (URL: /linear-swap-api/v1/swap_order) and place a batch of orders interface (URL:/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_batchorder):

- We recommend to fill in the parameter “client_order_id”(should be unique from
  user-side),which can help users to acquire order status and other order
  information according to the parameter “client_order_id" from
- query order information interface (URL: /linear-swap-api/v1/swap_order_info )
  when there is no returned information due to network or other problems.

#### 7\. The best deployment of program server

- It is recommended that place the server in AWS Tokyo C zone and use the
  api.hbdm.vn domain, which can effectively reduce network disconnection and
  network timeout.

api.

## Swap API FAQ

### Access and Authentication

#### Q1: Is the API Key for swap and spot the same ?

Yes. The Swap API key and spot API key are same. You can create API using the
following link. [click here](https://www.hbg.com/zh-cn/apikey/)

#### Q2: Why are APIs disconnected or timeout?

1.  The network connection is unstable if the server locates in China
    mainland,it is suggested to invoke APIS from a server located in 1c area of
    AWS Tokyo.
2.  You can use api.btcgateway.pro or api.hbdm.vn to debug for China mainland
    network.

#### Q3: Why is the websocket often disconnected?

It seems that most of the abnormal websocket issues (such as disconnect,
websocket close )(websocket: close 1006 (abnormal closure))are caused by
different network environment. The following measures can effectively reduce
websocket issues.

It would be better if the server is located in 1c area of AWS Tokyo with url
api.hbdm.vn and implement websocket re-connection mechanism. Both market
heartbeat and order heartbeat should response with Pong with different format,
following Websocket market heartbeat and account heartbeat
requirement.[here](https://docs.huobigroup.com/docs/usdt_swap/v1/en/#market-heartbeat)

#### Q4: what is the difference between api.hbdm.com and api.hbdm.vn?

The api.hbdm.vn uses AWS's CDN service. it should be more stable and faster for
AWS users. The api.hbdm.com uses Cloudflare's CDN service.

#### Q5: What is the colocation service ? which attention points should we know ?

Actually ,colo corresponds to a vpc node, which directly connects to private
network of HTX's future, so it will reduce the latency between the client and
the HTX future server (bypassing the CDN)

HTX future and HTX swap have the same colo, so the domain name connecting the
USDT Margined Contracts api and the future api are the same.

Note : Colo needs to use api.hbdm.com for signature(authentication) to avoid
getting 403 error: Verification failure.

#### Q6: Why does signature verification return failure (403: Verification failure) ?

The signature process of USDT Margined Contracts is similar to HTX future and
coin margined swap . In addition to the following precautions,please refer to
the swap or future demo to verify whether the signature is successful. Please
check your own signature code after demo verification is successful. The coin
margined swap code demo is
[here](https://docs.huobigroup.com/docs/coin_margined_swap/v1/en/#code-demo).
The future code demo is
[here](https://docs.huobigroup.com/docs/dm/v1/en/#code-demo). The USDT Margined
Contracts code demo is
[here](https://docs.huobigroup.com/docs/usdt_swap/v1/en/#code-demo).

1.  Check if the API key is valid and copied correctly.
2.  Check if the IP is in whitelist
3.  Check if th timestamp is UTC time
4.  Check if parameters are sorted alphabetically
5.  Check if the encoding is UTF-8
6.  Check if the signature has base64 encoding
7.  Any method with parameters for GET requests should be signed
8.  Any method with parameters for POST requests don't need to be signed
9.  Check if whether the signature is URI encoded and Hexadecimal characters
    must be capitalized, such as ":" should be encoded as "%3A", and the space
    shoule be encoded as "%20"
10. The authorization of websocket is similar to the authorization of restful
    interface.Pls note that the json body of the websocket authorization
    shouldn't be URL encoded
11. The host in signature text should be the same as the host in your API
    request.The proxy may change the request host, you can try without
    proxy;Some http/websocket library may include port in the host, you can try
    to append port in signature host, like "api.hbdm.com:443"
12. The hidden text in API Key and Secret Key may have impact on the signature.

If the reason for signature failure has not been found through the above
methods. And you can confirm that by this
[demo](https://github.com/hbdmapi/huobi_api_rules) which is specially explaining
the signature.

#### Q7: Is the ratelimit of public market based on IP ? Is the ratelimit of interface with private key based on UID?

Yes. The ratelimit of interface with private key is based on the UID, not the
API key. The master and sub accounts are separately ratelimited and don't affect
each other.

#### Q8: Is there any recommendation for third-party framework which integrates HTX swap?

There is an open source asynchronous quantization framework which integrates HTX
future and HTX swap: [here](https://github.com/hbdmapi/hbdm_Python). If you have
any quetsions, please open a ticket in github issues.

### Settlement

#### Q1: What is the USDT Margined Swap funding rate settlement cycle? Which interface can be used to check the status when the fund rate is settled?

We warmly remind you that HTX USDT Margined Swap is settled every 8 hours, and
the settlement will be at the end of each period. For example, 00:00 - 08:00 is
a period, and its settlement time would be at 08:00; 08:00 - 16:00 is a period,
and its settlement time would be at 16:00; 16:00 - 00:00 (+1 day) is a period,
and its settlement time would be at 00:00. All times mentioned above are
Singapore Standard time (GMT+8).

（1）Orders can't be placed or cancelled during settlement period, error code
"1056" will be returned if users place or cancel orders.

You are recommended to request contract information by this two ways:

- restful, every few seconds during settlement period to access:
  /linear-swap-api/v1/swap_contract_info
- websocket, Subscribe Contract Info (no authentication):
  public.\$symbol.contract_info

It's in settlement time if there is any number of 5, 6, 7, 8 included in the
returned status code of contract_status, while it indicates that settlement
completed and users could place and cancel orders as usual if the returned
status code is 1.

（2）When querying fund or position information during the settlement period,
error codes will be returned. Error code and their meaning are as following:

1.  Error code "1077" indicates that "the fund query of current perpetual swap
    trading pair failed during the settlement";
2.  Error code "1078" indicates that "the fund query of part of perpetual swap
    trading pairs failed during the settlement";
3.  Error code "1079" indicates that "the position query of current perpetual
    swap trading pair failed during the settlement";
4.  Error code "1080" indicates that "the position query of part of perpetual
    swap trading pairs failed during the settlement";

You are recommended to read the status code from the returned message. If the
above four types of status code appear, the returned data is not accurate and
couldn't be used as reference.

#### Q2: How to query the system status of the exchange?

There are two common statuses of the exchange systems: settlement/delivery in
progress; suspended for maintenance; when the system is in these two kinds of
statuses, the system will return the response error code and error information
when calling the related API interfaces.

a. How to judge whether the settlement/delivery has been done?

Users can judge from the value “contract_status” returned by the “Get
Information of an Order” interface (/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_contract_info);

or Subscribe Contract Info (no authentication): public.\$symbol.contract_info

If the return parameter contract_status is 1, it means that the
settlement/delivery has been done and the trading has been resumed now.

b. How to judge whether the system is suspended for maintenance or not?

Users can judge from the value “heartbeat” pushed by the “Queried if system
interface is available” interface (https://api.hbdm.com/heartbeat/)

or the “Subscribe system status updates” interface ("topic:
public.\$service.heartbeat");

If the return parameter heartbeat is 1, it means that the system is available

### Market and Websocket

#### Q1: How often are the snapshot orderbook subscription and incremental orderbook subscription pushed?

The snapshot orderbook subscription(market.\$contract_code.depth.\$type) is
checked once every 100MS.If there is an update,it will be pushed. It will be
pushed at least 1 second.The incremental orderbook subscription is checked once
every 30MS.If there is an update,it will be pushed.If there is no update, it
will not be pushed.

#### Q2: How often is the market trade subscription pushed?

The market trade subscription will be pushed when there is a transaction.

#### Q3: Are there historical Kline data or historical market trade data?

The historical kline data can be obtained via API interface
/market/history/kline with the request params from, to (the time period cannot
exceed two years). And the qty of data records cannot be exceeding 2000 in each
time.

The historical trade data can be obtained by subscribing the websocket topic:
market.\$symbol.trade.detail

or can be downloaded from
[download historical market data](https://futures.huobi.be/zh-cn/data/landing_page)

But also, you can download that data using
[The demo of downloading historical market data](https://github.com/hbdmapi/huobi_public_data)

#### Q4: How to get MACD and other technical indicators on Kline?

The API does not have interfaces to get technical indicators such as MACD. You
can refer to TradingView and other websites to calculate them.

#### Q5: What is the definition of timestamp in the document?

The timestamp in the document refers to the total number of seconds or total
milliseconds from Greenwich Mean Time, January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 (Beijing Time,
January 1, 1970, 08:00:00) to the present.

#### Q6: What is the definition of the 150 level and 20 level of MBP?

The Subscription of MBP data: market.\$contract_code.depth.\$type.150 price
level means the current bids and asks splited into 150 level by price.20 price
level means the current bids and asks splited into 20 level by price.

#### Q7: What is the meaning of merged depth when subscribing MBP data?

The subscrpition of MBP data:market.\$contract_code.depth.\$type：

step16 and step18 are merged by 7 decimal places.bids down,asks up.step17 and
step19 are merged by 6 decimal places.bids down,asks up.step1 and step7 are
merged by 5 decimal places.bids down,asks up.step2 and step8 are merged by 4
decimal places.bids down,asks up.step3 and step9 are merged by 3 decimal
places.bids down,asks up.step4 and step10 are merged by 2 decimal places.bids
down,asks up.step5 and step11 are merged by 1 decimal places.bids down,asks
up.step12 and step14 are combined by single digit.bids down,asks up.step13 and
step15 are combined by tens.bids down,asks up.

Example:

step4(0.01):

bids price: 100.123, 100.245.The merged bids price are 100.12, 100.24.

asks price: 100.123, 100.245The merged asks price are 100.13, 100.25.

("Down" and "Up" are rounded up or down, if the price is down, the asks price is
not rounded down, and the bids price is rounded up.)

150 price level: step0 to step5, step14 to step17；

20 price level: step6 to step13, step18, step19;

More examples：

step1(0.00001):

price: 1.123456The merged bid price is 1.12345.The merged ask price is 1.12346.

step7(0.00001):

price: 1.123456The merged bid price is 1.12345.The merged ask price is 1.12346.

step6(0.000001)

price: 1.123456The merged bid price is 1.123456.The merged ask price is
1.123456.

step11(0.1):

price: 1.123456The merged bid price is 1.1.The merged ask price is 1.1.

#### Q8:Does websocket's position channel push full data or incrementall data each time?

Subscription of position event: "positions.BTC-USDT".The latest position is
pushed,including the volumes, available volumes, frozen volumes.If there is no
update,it will not be pushed.

#### Q9: Does websocket's position channel push data when the unrealized profit is updated?

Subscription of position event: "positions.BTC-USDT".It will not be pushed if
only unrealized profit is updated.It will be pushed only when position event is
updated.

#### Q10: What is the difference between market detail and trade detail in WS?

Market Detail(market.\$contract_code.detail) is the merged market data. It will
be checked every 0.5s,pushed once trade event updates,including the OHLCV
data,etc.Trade Detail(market.\$contract_code.trade.detail) is pushed once trade
event updates,including trade price, trade volume, trade direction,etc.

#### Q11: What is the meaning of the two ts pushed by subscription of incremental MBP ?

Subscription of incremental
MBP：market.\$contract_code.depth.size\_\${size}.high_freq，The outer ts is the
timestamp when the market server sends the data.The inner ts is the timestamp
when the orderbook is checked.

#### Q12: What is the difference between websocket subscription of MBP and incremental MBP? How often is the incremental MBP pushed?

market.\$contract_code.depth.\$type is snapshot MBP
data，market.\$contract_code.depth.size\_\${size}.high_freq is incremental MBP
data.Snapshot MBP data is checked every 100ms,pushed at least every
1s.Incremental MBP data is checked every 30ms.It will not be pushed,if MBP has
no update.

#### Q13: How to maintain local MBP data subscribing incremental MBP:market.\$contract_code.depth.size\_\${size}.high_freq?

Snapshot MBP data will be pushed for the first time, and the incremental MBP
data will be pushed afterwards.

(1) Compare the incremental price with the previous full MBP data, and replace
the order amount with the same price;

(2) If the price is not in the local MBP data,add the price to the local MBP
data;

(3) If a price level is gone, data such as \[8100, 0\] will be pushed.You have
to remove the same price of local MBP data;

(4) For the same websocket connection, the incremental data version is
incremented; if the version is not incremented, you need to re-subscribe and
re-maintain the local full MBP data;

#### Q14: What's the difference between "funding_rate" and "realized_rate" in the response of /linear-swap-api/v1/swap_historical_funding_rate interface?

Generally, "funding_rate" is equal to "realized_rate".Only when the payment of
funding fee will cause the liquidation of the user's position, the funding fee
is under or not charged(And the fee is the actual funding
fee:"realized_rate").The current funding rate:"funding_rate" remains unchanged.

#### Q15: When subscribing the same topic of several contract codes, will several ws be needed?

Since Futures, Coin Margined swaps, USDT Margined Contracts and Options are
different contracts with different interface addresses, different ws will be
needed.

In Futures, Coin Margined swaps, USDT Margined Contracts and Options thereof, as
long as the interface address is the same, one ws is enough.

#### Q16: Is it available to place/cancel an order via WS??

Currently, it is not supported.

#### Q17: How to subscribe order status?

a. Successfully trade: “Subscribe Match Order Data
(matchOrders.\$contract_code)” or “Subscribe Order Data
(orders.\$contract_code)”

b. Successfully cancel: Subscribe Account Equity Updates Data
(accounts.\$contract_code)

#### Q18: What is the difference between the “Subscribe Match Order Data (matchOrders.\$contract_code)” and “Subscribe Order Data (orders.\$contract_code)”?

The pushed data of these two interfaces are different. Compared to “Subscribe
Match Order Data (matchOrders.\$contract_code)”, there are more fields for
“Subscribe Order Data (orders.\$contract_code)”

In general, the match order data (Subscribe Match Order Data
“matchOrders.\$contract_code”) may be pushed faster than the settled order data
(Subscribe Order Data “orders.\$contract_code”).

The orders of forced liquidation and netting will not be pushed in “Subscribe
Match Order Data (matchOrders.\$contract_code)”

#### Q19: How often is the “Subscribe Kline Data (market.\$contract_code.kline.\$period)” pushed?

If any transaction is completed, it will push every 500ms. If not, it will push
according to the subscribe period

#### Q20: How to judge whether the push is delayed?

Please first synchronize the time of the server through
https://api.hbdm.com/api/v1/timestamp), and the “ts” in the returned data is
timestamp (ms) and the corresponding time zone is UTC+8.

The outer layer of each pushed data has a “ts”, which represents the time stamp
(ms) when the server pushes the data to the client and the corresponding time
zone is UTC+8.

When the data pushed arrive, the procedure will record the local time “ts”. When
the local time “ts” is much later than the pushing data “ts”, you can use the
following methods to improve the delay:

a. Reduce the data pushed by reducing the number of WS subscriptions.

b. Check the stability and speed of the network between procedure and the
servers (please replace api.btcgateway.pro with the domain name used by the
program)

curl -o /dev/null -s -w
time_namelookup"(s)":%{time_namelookup}"\\n"time_connect"(s)":%{time_connect}"\\n"time_starttransfer"(s)":%{time_starttransfer}"\\n"time_total"(s)":%{time_total}"\\n"speed_download"(B/s)":%{speed_download}"\\n"
api.btcgateway.pro

and you will receive data as below:

time_namelookup(s):0.001378

time_connect(s):0.128641

time_starttransfer(s):0.276588

time_total(s):0.276804

speed_download(B/s):2010.000

If you run the above command multiple times in a row, and the results obtained
each time are very different, you can: a. Select an appropriate HTX domain name,
b. Optimize or reselect the network where the program is located.

### Order and Trade

#### Q1: What's the reason for 1004 error code?

We notice that the system is sometimes overloaded when the market suddenly turns
to be highly volatile. If the system is busy recently or the following prompts
appear:

{“status”: “error”, “err_code”: 1004, “err_msg”: “System busy. Please try again
later.”, “ts”:}

please be patient, and do not place or cancel order repeatedly during the
process to avoid repeated orders and additional pressure on system performance.
In the meanwhile, it is recommended to place and cancel orders through Web and
APP.

#### Q2: The same order ID and match ID can have multiple trades. for example: if a user take a large amount of maker orders, there will be multiple corresponding trades . How to identify these different trades ?

The field ID returned by the information interface
/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_order_detail is a globally unique transaction
identifier. if a maker order is matched multiple times, a trade will be pushed
once there is a transaction matched.

#### Q3: What is the delay for the round trip of HTX USDT Margined swap?

At present,it normally takes about 30-50ms from placing the order to getting the
status of the order.

#### Q4: Why does the API return connection reset or Max retris or Timeout error?

Most of the network connectivity problems ,(such as Connection reset or network
timeout ) are caused by network instability , you can use the server in AWS
Tokyo C area with api.hbdm.vn , which can effectively reduce network timeout
errors.

#### Q5: How to check the order status without order_id not returned?

If the order_id couldn't be returned due to network problems, you can query the
status of the order by adding the custom order number(client_order_id ).

#### Q6: What to do if it's diconnected after the websocket subscription of account, order and positions for a while?

When subscribing private accounts, orders and positions, the heartbeat should
also be maintained regularly ,which is different from the market heartbeat
format . Please refer to the "websocket Heartbeat and Authentication Interface"
. if it is disconnected ,please try to reconnect.

#### Q7: What is the difference between order status 1 and 2 ? what is the status 3 ?

Status 1 is the preparation for submission. status 2 is the sequential
submission of internal process, which can be considered that it has been
accepted by the system. Status 3 indicated that the order has been already
submitted to market.

#### Q8: Is there an interface to get the total assets in BTC of my account ?

No.

#### Q9: Why is the order filled after the order is withdrawed successfully by placing API cancellation ?

The success return of order cancellation or placement only represents that the
command is excuted successfully and doesn't mean that the order has been
cancelled . You can check the order status through the interface
/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_order_info.

#### Q10: Does the order status of 10 mean the order is failed?

Query the order status by /linear-swap-api/v1/swap_order_info.If the status is
10,the order is failed。

#### Q11: How long does it generally take for an API from withdrawing to cancelling successfully ?

The order cancellation command generally takes several tens of ms. The actual
status of order cancellation can be obtained by invoking an interface:
/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_order_info

#### Q12: How to get historical liquidation orders?

To obtain historical liquidation orders, you can access the one of two api
interfaces: Get History Orders (/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_hisorders【Isolated】or
/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_cross_hisorders【Cross】), Get History Match Results
(/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_matchresults【Isolated】or
/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_cross_matchresults【Cross】) with the return field
order_source (order source) to judge. When order_source returns "risk", it means
that this order is a liquidated order.

#### Q13: Does Huob Futures support holding bi-directional position?

Yes, HTX Futures supports long and short positions being held at the same time.

#### Q14: How to ensure the order to be rapidly filled?

At present, HTX Futures does not support market price when placing an order. To
increase the probability of a transaction, users can choose to place an order
based on BBO price (opponent), optimal 5 (optimal_5), optimal 10 (optimal_10),
optimal 20 (optimal_20), among which the success probability of optimal 20 is
the largest, while the slippage always is the largest as well.

It is important to note that the above methods will not guarantee the order to
be filled in 100%. The system will obtain the optimal N price at that moment and
place the order.

#### Q15: How can API procedure be connected to the exchange more rapidly?

It’s recommended to use a AWS Tokyo c-zone server and the domain name
“api.hbdm.vn” to connect to the system.

#### Q16: It occurs an “abnormal service” error when transferring assets between spots and derivatives.

a. Check whether the request address is the address of HTX: api.huobi.pro?

b. Check whether the precision of the coin does not exceed 8 decimal places?

#### Q17: How to confirm whether the position is opened or closed successfully?

Placing an order successfully through “Place an Order” interface
(/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_order) or “Place a batch of orders” interface
(/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_batchorder) just means the server has received your
order placing instructions rather than you have opened/closed a position
successfully.

You can check the order status by filling the returned “order_id” in the “Get
Information of an Order” interface (/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_order_info) or the
“Order Details Acquisition” interface (/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_order_detail);
If the order has been filled, the “status” value in the return parameter will
turn out 6 (wholly filled)

It is important to note:

a. For “Get Information of an order” interface
(/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_order_info), after the settlement or delivery, the
system will delete all the orders in ended status (5: partially filled orders
have been cancelled; 6: wholly filled; 7: cancelled);

b. There is a delay in “Order Details Acquisition” interface
(/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_order_detail), so it is better to fill in “created_at”
(order timestamp) and “order_type” (order type, fill in 1 by default). In this
way, it will directly query the database, so the query results will be more
timely.

#### Q18: Why are orders canceled by the system automatically?

The order_price_type which can be chosen are IOC, FOK and Maker (Post Only).
When the order book cannot meet with the corresponding conditions, the system
will cancel the orders automatically:

Post_only: If the order placed is filled with an existing order on the order
book immediately, the order will be cancelled to ensure the user is always a
maker.

IOC order: If the order cannot be filled immediately, the unfilled part will be
cancelled at once;

FOK order: If the order cannot be filled in its entirety, it will be wholly
cancelled. No partial fulfillments are allowed.

#### Q19: How to query the maximum amount (cont) available to open by using users’ current assets?

At present, we do not have an interface by which users can directly query the
maximum amount (cont) available to open by using users’ the current asset.

#### Q20: Are the “order_id” and “order_id_str” the same?

The “order_id_str” is the string format of “order_id”, whose values are the
same.

For the “order_id” with 18 bits, the “JSON.parse” in “nodejs” and “javascript”
will be “int” by default, and mistakes will occur when analyzing. Thus, we
advise using “order_id_str”.

#### Q21: How to get the active buying/selling quantity in transaction data?

Users can get the data via “Query The Last Trade of a Contract”
(/linear-swap-ex/market/trade) interface or by subscribing "sub":
"market.\$contract_code.trade.detail", thereinto

Amount refers to the trading volume (cont), which is the sum of the
buying/selling volume;

Direction refers to the active trading direction.

#### Q22: The interval between “from” and “to” is “2000\*period” when acquiring KLine data, then why the data obtained is \[\]?

When acquiring the Kline data, the two time points “from” and “to” are
contained, therefore it includes 2001 pieces of data. However, this exceeds the
maximum limit 2000. Therefore, the system will return \[\].

Besides, the returned data will be \[\] as well if the interval between “from”
and “to” exceeds 2 years.

#### Q23: How to get the latest price?

There are two methods to get the latest price:

a. Invoking the “Get KLine Data(/linear-swap-ex/market/history/kline)” interface
and filling in any “period”, the “close” of the last data in return data will be
the latest price;

b. Invoking the “Query The Last Trade of a
Contract(/linear-swap-ex/market/trade)” interface, the returned “price” will be
the latest price.

#### Q24: How to get the latest index price?

There are two methods to get the latest index price:

a. Calling the “Get Contract Index Price Information” interface
(/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_index), the returned “index_price” will be the latest
index price.

b. Calling the “Subscribe Index Kline Data” websocket
(market.\$contract_code.index.\$period), the “close” of the last Kline data in
returned data will be the latest index price.

#### Q25: Will API upgrade affect the operation of the program?

In general, API upgrade will partly influence the ws disconnection. To avoid
this, you can set up a ws-reconnect mechanism in advance; Please subscribe to
the upgrade announcements for more details:

Coin-margined futures: https://status-dm.huobigroup.com/

Coin-margined swaps: https://status-swap.huobigroup.com/

USDT-margined Contracts: https://status-linear-swap.huobigroup.com/

#### Q26: What does mean the “margin_balance” in “Query User’s Account Information” interface (api/v1/contract_account_info)?

”margin_balance” refers to the account equity

1.  margin_balance = margin_static + profit_unreal
2.  margin_balance = Account balance + profit_real + profit_unreal

Note: Account balance = margin_static - profit_real, there is only margin_static
in the return data of api interface

Each of the two calculation methods above can get the margin_balance

#### Q27: Is the “risk_rate” (margin rate) in “Query User’s Account Information” interface (/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_account_info) the same as the margin rate on WEB?

Yes, it is

When the “risk_rate” is less than or equal to 0, the position will be
liquidated.

### Error Codes

#### Q1: What is the reason for 1030 error code?

If you encounter errors such as
{"status":"error","err_code":1030,"err_msg":"Abnormal service. Please try again
later.","ts":1588093883199},indicating that your input request parameter is not
correct, please print your request body and complete URL parameters, and please
check the corresponding API document interface one by one.The common example is
that the volume must be an integer.

#### Q2: What is the reason for 1048 error code?

If you encounter errors such as {'index': 1, 'err_code': 1048, 'err_msg':
'Insufficient close amount available.'}, indicating that your available position
is not enough.You need to query the api /linear-swap-api/v1/swap_position_info
to get your available position.

1.  Check whether the amount (cont) of position-closing order exceeds the limit?
    (When there is limit order for closing a position, the quantity that
    available to be closed will be occupied; hence we kindly remind you to
    cancel these orders and try again.)
2.  Check whether direction and offset are wrong as follows:

close long: sell to close a long position (direction: sell; offset: close);

close short: buy to close a short position (direction: buy; offset: close);

Only “direction” need to be uploaded when placing a flash close order (close
long: sell; close short: buy).

1.  The pending take-profit and stop-loss (tp/sl) orders and trigger orders will
    not occupy the quantity of the position.

#### Q3: What is the reason for 1032 error code?

1032 means that your request exceeds the ratelimit. The coin margined swap,
future and USDT margined Contracts limit the rate separately. Please check the
ratelimit in the api ratelimit instructions, and you can print the current
ratelimit in the header of the API response to check whether the ratelimit is
exceeded. It is recommended to increase the request interval delay to avoid
exceeding the ratelimit.

### The usage of and the difference between cross margin mode and isolated margin mode

1.  Under the cross margin mode, all swaps share the USDT in the cross margin
    account as the margin, which indicates that all positions under the cross
    margin mode share the same account equity, and their PnL, occupied margin
    and margin ratio are calculated jointly. Under the isolated margin mode, the
    account equity for each swaps are calculated separately, and the position
    margin and PnL of each swaps will not affect each other.
2.  The cross margin mode and the isolated margin mode use different margin
    accounts, and the assets are independent of each other. Users can trade, or
    hold positions under the two modes at the same time. For example, in
    BTC/USDT swaps trading, the margin account for cross margin trading is USDT,
    while the margin account for isolated margin trading is BTC-USDT.
3.  API users can use the support_margin_mode field (margin mode supported by
    the contract) of the API interface \[Query Swap Info:
    linear-swap-api/v1/swap_contract_info\] to check which mode (cross/isolated)
    the contract supports.
4.  The API interface is divided into three modes, \[Cross\], \[Isolated\] and
    \[General\]. These three modes are marked on the API interface name and the
    interface list. \[Cross\] indicates that the API interface only supports
    cross margin mode. \[Isolated\] indicates that the API interface only
    supports isolated margin mode, and \[General\] indicates that the API
    interface supports both two modes, indicating that it can be called by both
    the cross margin mode and isolated margin mode.

### How to solve problems more effectively?

When you report an API error, you need to attach your request URL, the original
complete body of the request and the complete request URL parameters, and the
original complete log of the server's response. If it is a websocket
subscription, you need to provide the address of the subscription, the topic of
the subscription, and the original complete log pushed by the server.

If it is an order-related issue, use the API order query interface
/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_order_info to keep the complete log returned and
provide your UID and order number.

Notes:

When from_margin_account or to_margin_account is USDT, it means the transfer in
or transfer out from cross margin account

represents transfer from transfer_out margin account to transfer_in margin
account. The currency transferred shall be the same as the denominated currency
of the transfer_out margin account.；

The denominated currency of the transfer_out margin account and transfer_in
margin account must be the same. (eg, USDT can be transferred from BTC-USDT to
ETH-USDT, but cannot be transferred from BTC-USDT to ETH-HUSD account).

the rate limit between the master account and each subaccount is 10 times/
minute

The client_order_id is valid in 8 hours only, that is the user cannot use the
same client_order_id beyonds one times for the same transfer path (for example,
transfer currency from master account to sub-account using client_order_id=1,
and you can't do that transfe currency from master account to sub-account using
client_order_id=1 in the next time; but you can transfer currency from
sub-account to master account using client_order_id=1).

Notes:

When from_margin_account or to_margin_account is USDT, it means the transfer in
or transfer out from cross margin account

represents transfer from transfer_out margin account to transfer_in margin
account. The currency transferred shall be the same as the denominated currency
of the transfer_out margin account.；

The denominated currency of the transfer_out margin account and transfer_in
margin account must be the same. (eg, USDT can be transferred from BTC-USDT to
ETH-USDT, but cannot be transferred from BTC-USDT to ETH-HUSD account)。

API rate limit for this interface is up to 10 times per minute.

The client_order_id is valid in 8 hours only, that is the user cannot use the

### /linear-swap-api/v1/linear-cancel-after (\[General\] Automatic Order Cancellation)

Request type: POST

Signature verification: Yes

Interface permission: Trade

Interface description: HTX Futures launches the automatic order cancellation
interface to prevent API users from incurring unexpected losses in the event of
network failures or client system failures that result in a loss of
communication with the HTX system. When users experience an unexpected
disconnection from HTX's system, this interface automatically cancels all
pending orders (including both opening and closing orders) to mitigate potential
losses through its Dead Man's Switch functionality. If the interface is not
called again within the specified period, all of the user's pending futures
orders will be canceled.

Notes:

"limit"，"post_only"，"ioc" and "fok" the four order price type need price value
and the other don't need.

Post-Only orders are limit orders that will never take liquidity (also called
maker-only order). There are order limit and position for post-only orders which
the upper limit is 5,000,000 for open/close orders.

If you’re holding a position currently, the leverage you choose when placing an
order should be the same as the leverage of your current positions, otherwise,
the order will fail to be placed. If you need a new leverage to place an order,
you should switch the leverage of current positions first by using the Switch
Leverage interface.

Only open orders can support setting take profit and stop loss.

The take profit trigger price is a required field for setting a take profit
order, and the stop loss trigger price is a required field for setting a stop
loss order; if the trigger price field is not filled in, the corresponding take
profit order or stop loss order will not be set.

Description of post_only: assure that the maker order remains as maker order, it
will not be filled immediately with the use of post_only, for the match system
will automatically check whether the price of the maker order is higher/lower
than the opponent first price, i.e. higher than bid price 1 or lower than the
ask price 1. If yes, the maker order will placed on the orderbook, if not, the
maker order will be cancelled.

offset, in hedge mode it is a required field, and in one-way mode it is optional
paramater which's value must be both when filled.

open long: direction - buy、offset - open

close long: direction -sell、offset - close

open short: direction -sell、offset - open

close short: direction -buy、offset - close

optimal BBO price (No need to transfer price data) ，limit": limit order,

Risk Reminder:By using Best Bid/Offer( bbo ), you are to place limit orders at
the best prices offered by the opposite side. In the event of extreme volatility
or insufficient liquidity，there is a risk that your orders may not be filled in
full. Any unfilled part will remain open in the market pending further
execution. Selecting BBO means you understand how this order type is executed
and acknowledge to bear the risk of incomplete execution.

Notes:

The return order_id is 18 bits, it will make mistake when nodejs and JavaScript
analysed 18 bits. Because the Json.parse in nodejs and JavaScript is int by
default. so the number over 18 bits need be parsed by json-bigint package.

Notes:

"limit"，"post_only"，"ioc" and "fok" the four order price type need price value
and the other don't need.

Post-Only orders are limit orders that will never take liquidity (also called
maker-only order). There are order limit and position for post-only orders which
the upper limit is 5,000,000 for open/close orders.

If you’re holding a position currently, the leverage you choose when placing an
order should be the same as the leverage of your current positions, otherwise,
the order will fail to be placed. If you need a new leverage to place an order,
you should switch the leverage of current positions first by using the Switch
Leverage interface.

Only open orders can support setting take profit and stop loss.

The take profit trigger price is a required field for setting a take profit
order, and the stop loss trigger price is a required field for setting a stop
loss order; if the trigger price field is not filled in, the corresponding take
profit order or stop loss order will not be set.

Description of post_only: assure that the maker order remains as maker order, it
will not be filled immediately with the use of post_only, for the match system
will automatically check whether the price of the maker order is higher/lower
than the opponent first price, i.e. higher than bid price 1 or lower than the
ask price 1. If yes, the maker order will placed on the orderbook, if not, the
maker order will be cancelled.

offset, in hedge mode it is a required field, and in one-way mode it is optional
paramater which's value must be both when filled.

open long: direction - buy、offset - open

close long: direction -sell、offset - close

open short: direction -sell、offset - open

close short: direction -buy、offset - close

Risk Reminder:By using Best Bid/Offer( bbo ), you are to place limit orders at
the best prices offered by the opposite side. In the event of extreme volatility
or insufficient liquidity，there is a risk that your orders may not be filled in
full. Any unfilled part will remain open in the market pending further
execution. Selecting BBO means you understand how this order type is executed
and acknowledge to bear the risk of incomplete execution.

Notes:

The return order_id is 18 bits, it will make mistake when nodejs and JavaScript
analysed 18 bits. Because the Json.parse in nodejs and JavaScript is int by
default. so the number over 18 bits need be parsed by json-bigint package.

Notes:

"limit"，"post_only"，"ioc" and "fok" the four order price type need price value
and the other don't need.

Description of post_only: assure that the maker order remains as maker order, it
will not be filled immediately with the use of post_only, for the match system
will automatically check whether the price of the maker order is higher/lower
than the opponent first price, i.e. higher than bid price 1 or lower than the
ask price 1. If yes, the maker order will placed on the orderbook, if not, the
maker order will be cancelled.

If you’re holding a position currently, the leverage you choose when placing an
order should be the same as the leverage of your current positions, otherwise,
the order will fail to be placed. If you need a new leverage to place an order,
you should switch the leverage of current positions first by using the Switch
Leverage interface.

Only open orders can support setting take profit and stop loss.

The take profit trigger price is a required field for setting a take profit

Notes:

The return order_id is 18 bits, it will make mistake when nodejs and JavaScript
analysed 18 bits. Because the Json.parse in nodejs and JavaScript is int by
default. so the number over 18 bits need be parsed by json-bigint package.

Notes:

"limit"，"post_only"，"ioc" and "fok" the four order price type need price value
and the other don't need.

Description of post_only: assure that the maker order remains as maker order, it
will not be filled immediately with the use of post_only, for the match system
will automatically check whether the price of the maker order is higher/lower
than the opponent first price, i.e. higher than bid price 1 or lower than the
ask price 1. If yes, the maker order will placed on the orderbook, if not, the
maker order will be cancelled.

If you’re holding a position currently, the leverage you choose when placing an
order should be the same as the leverage of your current positions, otherwise,
the order will fail to be placed. If you need a new leverage to place an order,
you should switch the leverage of current positions first by using the Switch
Leverage interface.

Only open orders can support setting take profit and stop loss.

The take profit trigger price is a required field for setting a take profit
order, and the stop loss trigger price is a required field for setting a stop
loss order; if the trigger price field is not filled in, the corresponding take
profit order or stop loss order will not be set.

offset, in hedge mode it is a required field, and in one-way mode it is optional
paramater which's value must be both when filled.

25 orders at most

Risk Reminder:By using Best Bid/Offer( bbo ), you are to place limit orders at
the best prices offered by the opposite side. In the event of extreme volatility
or insufficient liquidity，there is a risk that your orders may not be filled in
full. Any unfilled part will remain open in the market pending further
execution. Selecting BBO means you understand how this order type is executed
and acknowledge to bear the risk of incomplete execution.

Notes:

The return order_id is 18 bits, it will make mistake when nodejs and JavaScript
analysed 18 bits. Because the Json.parse in nodejs and JavaScript is int by
default. so the number over 18 bits need be parsed by json-bigint package.

Notes:

The real_profit is calculated with the average price in open position and the
transaction average price in close position (the real profit is the sum of each
profit of order matched).

Only of the order information that orders created after 0:00 on January 30,
2021, the real profit (real_profit) parameter has a value. And in the other
orders created before that times, it is 0.

Notes:

When getting information on order cancellation via get order Information
interface, users can only query last 2-hour data

Both order_id and client_order_id can be used for order withdrawl，one of them
needed at one time，if both of them are set，the default will be order id. The
order completed( 5.partially fulfilled but cancelled by client; 6. Fully
fulfilled; 7. Cancelled; ) will be deleted after the settlement of funding rate
on 00:00(GMT+8), 08:00(GMT+8) and 16:00(GMT+8).

Notes:

The real_profit is calculated with the average price in open position and the
transaction average price in close position (the real profit is the sum of each
profit of order matched).

Only of the order information that orders created after 0:00 on January 30,
2021, the real profit (real_profit) parameter has a value. And in the other
orders created before that times, it is 0.

Notes:

When getting information on order cancellation via query order detail interface,
users who type in parameters “created_at” and “order_type” can query last 6-hour
data, while users who don’t type in parameters “created_at” and “order_type” can
only query last 2-hour data.

The return order_id is 18 bits, it will make mistake when nodejs and JavaScript
analysed 18 bits. Because the Json.parse in nodejs and JavaScript is int by
default. so the number over 18 bits need be parsed by jaso-bigint package.

created_at should use timestamp of long type as 13 bits (include Millisecond),
if send the accurate timestamp for "created_at", query performance will be
improved.

Please note that created_at can't be "0"

Notes:

The real_profit is calculated with the average price in open position and the
transaction average price in close position (the real profit is the sum of each
profit of order matched).

Only of the order information that orders created after 0:00 on January 30,
2021, the real profit (real_profit) parameter has a value. And the real profit
(real_profit) of the transaction information that orders traded after December
10, 2020 has a value.

Notes:

When getting information on order cancellation via query order detail interface,
users who type in parameters “created_at” and “order_type” can query last 6-hour
data, while users who don’t type in parameters “created_at” and “order_type” can
only query last 2-hour data.

The return order_id is 18 bits, it will make mistake when nodejs and JavaScript
analysed 18 bits. Because the Json.parse in nodejs and JavaScript is int by
default. so the number over 18 bits need be parsed by jaso-bigint package.

created_at should use timestamp of long type as 13 bits (include Millisecond),
if send the accurate timestamp for "created_at", query performance will be
improved.

Please note that created_at can't be "0"

Notes:

The real_profit is calculated with the average price in open position and the
transaction average price in close position (the real profit is the sum of each
profit of order matched).

Only of the order information that orders created after 0:00 on January 30,
2021, the real profit (real_profit) parameter has a value. And the real profit
(real_profit) of the transaction information that orders traded after December
10, 2020 has a value.

Notes:

The real_profit is calculated with the average price in open position and the
transaction average price in close position (the real profit is the sum of each
profit of order matched).

Only of the order information that orders created after 0:00 on January 30,
2021, the real profit (real_profit) parameter has a value. And in the other
orders created before that times, it is 0.

Notes:

The real_profit is calculated with the average price in open position and the
transaction average price in close position (the real profit is the sum of each
profit of order matched).

Only of the order information that orders created after 0:00 on January 30,
2021, the real profit (real_profit) parameter has a value. And in the other
orders created before that times, it is 0.

Notes:

The real_profit is calculated with the average price in open position and the
transaction average price in close position (the real profit is the sum of each
profit of order matched).

Only of the order information that orders created after 0:00 on January 30,
2021, the real profit (real_profit) parameter has a value. And in the other
orders created before that times, it is 0.

can avoid the loss of users when the order cannot be completed when the market
price rises sharply and falls sharply.

If you’re holding a position currently, the leverage you choose when placing an
order should be the same as the leverage of your current positions, otherwise,
the order will fail to be placed. If you need a new leverage to place an order,
you should switch the leverage of current positions first by using the Switch
Leverage interface.

paramater which's value must be both when filled.

please note that, in the one-way mode, if using the parameter reduce_only=1 to
place an order for opening positions, when the order triggered, it will respond
error message: 1492 Amount of Reduce Only order exceeds the amount available to
close. order will be failed.

Notes:

When order_price_type is the formula_price, it means that after the tracking
order is triggered successfully, use the lowest (highest) market price \*(1 ±
callback rate) that from statistic since place trading order, as the order price
(the precision is the minimum variation of the contract price and be truncated)
to place a limit price order

whether filled in with the optimal N or the formula price, there is no guarantee
that the order can be completely filled, which mainly depends on the market
conditions.

offset, in hedge mode it is a required field, and in one-way mode it is optional
paramater which's value must be both when filled.

please note that, in the one-way mode, if using the parameter reduce_only=1 to
place an order for opening positions, when the order triggered, it will respond
error message: 1492 Amount of Reduce Only order exceeds the amount available to
close. order will be failed.

Notes:

When order_price_type is the formula_price, it means that after the tracking
order is triggered successfully, use the lowest (highest) market price \*(1 ±
callback rate) that from statistic since place trading order, as the order price
(the precision is the minimum variation of the contract price and be truncated)
to place a limit price order

whether filled in with the optimal N or the formula price, there is no guarantee
that the order can be completely filled, which mainly depends on the market
conditions.

offset, in hedge mode it is a required field, and in one-way mode it is optional
paramater which's value must be both when filled.

please note that, in the one-way mode, if using the parameter reduce_only=1 to
place an order for opening positions, when the order triggered, it will respond
error message: 1492 Amount of Reduce Only order exceeds the amount available to
close. order will be failed.
