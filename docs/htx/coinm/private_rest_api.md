### Colocation

#### Solution Architecture

HTX futures API colocation solution is built on AWS infrastructure. Client will connect via AWS “PrivateLink” to access HTX’s services directly through fast AWS connection without being routed to public networks.

#### Performance Improvement

The network delay of colocation solution is estimated to be 10ms to 50ms faster than the ordinary connection. This improvement estimated should be used as a guidance only as the actual improvement depends on many factors.

#### Eligibility

Colocation is only available to higher tier market makers. To check if your account is eligible please talk to your dedicated account manager.

#### Setting

### Risk Mechanism

#### Partial Liquidation

Margin ratio is an indicator to estimate the risk of users’assets. When the margin ratio is less than or equal to 0%, liquidation will be triggered.

It is recommended that you pay close attention to margin ratio changes, so as to avoid your positions from liquidation.

HTX contracts implement a partial liquidation mechanism, in which the system will lower the corresponding tier of an adjustment factor to avoid your positions from being liquidated at one time.

More detail to see: [Partial Liquidation of Futures](https://www.huobi.com/support/en-us/detail/360000143042)

#### Insurance Funds and Clawback Mechanism

Insurance funds are designed to cover the losses from forced liquidation.

In a fluctuating market, users’ positions may be liquidated. When the order cannot be filled at the takeover price, resulting in huge losses that are greater than the part insurance funds can undertake, the platform will implement the “clawback” mechanism. Each profitable account in the current period compensates the over loss of liquidation according to its profit ratio.

More detail in here: [Partial Liquidation of Futures](https://www.huobi.com/support/en-us/detail/360000143042)

#### Tiered Adjustment Factor

The adjustment factor is designed to prevent users from extended margin call loss. HTX Contracts use a tiered adjustment factor mechanism, which supports up to five tiers based on the position amount.

For contracts with different expirations under the different account modes, they are separately calculated. The larger the use’s net positions, the higher the tier, and the greater the risk.

More detail in here: [Tiered Adjustment Factors of Coin-margined Futures](https://www.huobi.com/support/en-us/detail/360000293121)

### Matching Mechanism

1.  Matching System: Order accepted by the Order System will enter the Matching System. Once orders are matched/filled, the settlement service will be executed and the matching result will be returned to the Order System; otherwise, the unfilled orders will go into the order book for matching.
    
2.  Price Priority: Higher-priced buy orders have priority over lower-priced buy orders; the reverse is true, lower-priced sell orders have priority over higher-priced sell orders.
    
3.  Time Priority: Buy orders at the same price are executed according to the time of entry to the Server.
    
4.  When the highest bid price is the same as the lowest ask price of the order book, this price is what we call transaction price.
    
5.  When the bid price is higher than the lowest ask price of the order book up to the minute, the lowest ask price will be the transaction price.
    
6.  When the ask price is lower than the highest bid price of the order book up to the minute, the highest bid price will be the transaction price.

### Signature Authentication & Verification

#### Signature Illustration

Considering that API requests may get tampered in the process of transmission, to keep the transmission secure, you have to use your API Key to do Signature Authentication for all private interface except for public interface (used for acuqiring basic information and market data), in this way to verify whether the parameters/ parameter value get tampered or not in the process of transmission

A legitimate request consists of following parts：

-   Request address of method, i.e. visit server address--api.hbdm.com, e.g.: api.hbdm.com/api/v1/contract\_order
    
-   API Access Key ID (AccessKeyId): Access Key of the API Key that you apply.
    
-   Method of Signature (SignatureMethod): The first one is for users to use the elliptic curve digital signature algorithm, using Ed25519. ‌The second, hash-based protocol for user-computed signatures, uses HmacSHA256.
    
-   Ed25519 introduction: It is a high-performance digital signature algorithm that provides fast signature verification and generation while having high security.
-   Signature Version (SignatureVersion): It adopts version 2 in terms of Signature Version.
    
-   Timestamp (Timestamp): The time when you send the request (UTC time zone) : (UTC time zone) : (UTC time zone), e.g.: 2017-05-11T16:22:06
    
-   Must-fill parameters & optional parameters: For each method, there are a group of must-fill parameters and optional parameters used to address the API request, which can be found in the illustration of each method as well as their meaning. Please note that, in terms of "Get" requests, it needs to do Signature calculation for all the original parameters in each method ; In terms of "Post" requests, no need to do Signature calculation for the original parameters in each method, which means only four parameters need to do Signature calculation in "Post" requests, i.e. AccessKeyId, SignatureMethod, SignatureVersion, Timestamp with other parameters placed in "body".
    
-   Signature: The result of Signature calculation which is used to verify if signature is valid and not tampered.
    

#### Create API Key

[You could create API Key at](https://www.hbg.com/zh-cn/apikey/)

API Key consists of the following two parts.

-   "Access Key", the Key used to visit API.
    
-   "Secret Key", the Key used to do Signature authentication and verification (visible during application period).
    

When create API Key, users could bind IP address, as the validity of unbond IP address is only 90 days.

API Key has operation authorization of trading, borrowing, deposit and withdrawal etc..

Both Access Key and Secret Key are closely related with account security, please do not disclose them to others for any reasons anytime.

#### Ed25519 Steps for Signature

Normative request for Signature calculation Different contents will get totally different results when use HMAC to calculate Signature, therefore, please normalize the requests before doing Signature calculation. Take the request of inquering order details as an example:

query details of one order

`[https://api.hbdm.com/api/v1/contract_order](https://api.hbdm.com/api/v1/contract_order)?`

`AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx`

`&SignatureMethod=Ed25519`

`&SignatureVersion=2`

`&Timestamp=2017-05-11T15:19:30`

#### 1\. Request methods (GET/POST): add line breaker "\\n".

`POST\n`

#### 2\. Text the visit address in lowercase, adding line breake "\\n"

`[api.hbdm.com](http://api.hbdm.com)\n`

#### 3\. Visit the path of methods, adding line breaker "\\n"

`/api/v1/contract_order\n`

#### 4\. Rank the parameter names according to the sequence of ASCII codes, for example, below is the parameters in original sequence and the new sequence:

`AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx`

`SignatureMethod=Ed25519`

`SignatureVersion=2`

`Timestamp=2017-05-11T15%3A19%3A30`

Use UTF-8 to encode when it has already been encoded by URI with hexadecimals in Uppercase, e.g., ":" wiil be encoded to "%3A" while space to "%20".Timestamp should be written in the form of YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss and encoded with URI.

#### 5\. After ranking

`AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx`

`SignatureMethod=Ed25519`

`SignatureVersion=2`

`Timestamp=2017-05-11T15%3A19%3A30`

#### 6\. Following the sequence above, link parameters with "&"

`AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx&SignatureMethod=Ed25519&SignatureVersion=2&Timestamp=2017-05-11T15%3A19%3A30`

#### 7\. Form the final character strings that need to do Signature calculation as following:

`POST\n`

`[api.hbdm.com](http://api.hbdm.com)\n`

`/api/v1/contract_order\n`

`AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx&SignatureMethod=Ed25519&SignatureVersion=2&Timestamp=2017-05-11T15%3A19%3A30`

#### 8\. Use the "request character strings" formed in the last step and your Secret Key to create a digital Signature.

`4F65x5A2bLyMWVQj3Aqp+B4w+ivaA7n5Oi2SuYtCJ9o=`

1.  Use the request string obtained in the previous step to generate the private key of Ed25519 and add it to generate a signature.
2.  Encode the generated signature with base-64, and the resulting value is used as the digital signature of this interface call.

#### 9\. Add the digital Signature into the parameters of request path.

The final request sent to Server via API should be like:

`https://api.hbdm.com/api/v1/contract_order?AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx&order-id=1234567890&SignatureMethod=Ed25519&SignatureVersion=2&Timestamp=2017-05-11T15%3A19%3A30&Signature=4F65x5A2bLyMWVQj3Aqp%2BB4w%2BivaA7n5Oi2SuYtCJ9o%3D`

1.  Add all the must authentication parameters into the parameters of request path;
    
2.  Add the digital Signature encoded with URL code into the path parameters with the parameter name of "Signature".
    

#### HmacSHA256 Steps for Signature

Normative request for Signature calculation Different contents will get totally different results when use HMAC to calculate Signature, therefore, please normalize the requests before doing Signature calculation. Take the request of inquering order details as an example:

query details of one order

`[https://api.hbdm.com/api/v1/contract_order](https://api.hbdm.com/api/v1/contract_order)?`

`AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx`

`&SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256`

`&SignatureVersion=2`

`&Timestamp=2017-05-11T15:19:30`

#### 1\. Request methods (GET/POST): add line breaker "\\n".

`POST\n`

#### 2\. Text the visit address in lowercase, adding line breake "\\n"

`[api.hbdm.com](http://api.hbdm.com)\n`

#### 3\. Visit the path of methods, adding line breaker "\\n"

`/api/v1/contract_order\n`

#### 4\. Rank the parameter names according to the sequence of ASCII codes, for example, below is the parameters in original sequence and the new sequence:

`AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx`

`SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256`

`SignatureVersion=2`

`Timestamp=2017-05-11T15%3A19%3A30`

Use UTF-8 to encode when it has already been encoded by URI with hexadecimals in Uppercase, e.g., ":" wiil be encoded to "%3A" while space to "%20".Timestamp should be written in the form of YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss and encoded with URI.

#### 5\. After ranking

`AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx`

`SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256`

`SignatureVersion=2`

`Timestamp=2017-05-11T15%3A19%3A30`

#### 6\. Following the sequence above, link parameters with "&"

`AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx&SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256&SignatureVersion=2&Timestamp=2017-05-11T15%3A19%3A30`

#### 7\. Form the final character strings that need to do Signature calculation as following:

`POST\n`

`[api.hbdm.com](http://api.hbdm.com)\n`

`/api/v1/contract_order\n`

`AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx&SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256&SignatureVersion=2&Timestamp=2017-05-11T15%3A19%3A30`

#### 8\. Use the "request character strings" formed in the last step and your Secret Key to create a digital Signature.

`4F65x5A2bLyMWVQj3Aqp+B4w+ivaA7n5Oi2SuYtCJ9o=`

1.  Take the request character string formed in the last step and API Secret Key as two parameters, encoding them with the Hash Function HmacSHA256 to get corresponding Hash value.
    
2.  Encoding the Hash value with base-64 code, the result will be the digital Signature of this request.
    

#### 9\. Add the digital Signature into the parameters of request path.

The final request sent to Server via API should be like:

`[https://api.hbdm.com/api/v1/contract_order?AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx&order-id=1234567890&SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256&SignatureVersion=2&Timestamp=2017-05-11T15%3A19%3A30&Signature=4F65x5A2bLyMWVQj3Aqp%2BB4w%2BivaA7n5Oi2SuYtCJ9o%3D](https://api.hbdm.com/api/v1/contract_order?AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx&order-id=1234567890&SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256&SignatureVersion=2&Timestamp=2017-05-11T15%3A19%3A30&Signature=4F65x5A2bLyMWVQj3Aqp%2BB4w%2BivaA7n5Oi2SuYtCJ9o%3D)`

1.  Add all the must authentication parameters into the parameters of request path;
    
2.  Add the digital Signature encoded with URL code into the path parameters with the parameter name of "Signature".

### API Rate Limit Illustration

Future, Coin Margined Swap and USDT Margined Contracts are using separate API rate limits.

Please note that, for both public interface and private interface, there are rate limits, more details are as below:

-   Generally, the private interface rate limit of API key is at most 72 times every 3 seconds for each UID (Trade Interface: at most 36 times every 3 seconds. Read Interface: at most 36 times every 3 seconds) (this rate limit is shared by all the altcoins contracts delivered by different date). [API Interface List](https://docs.huobigroup.com/docs/dm/v1/en/#api-list)
    
-   For public interface used to get information of index, price limit, settlement, delivery, open positions and so on, the rate limit is 120 times every 3 seconds at most for each IP (this 120 times every 3 seconds public interface rate limit is shared by all the requests from that IP of non-marketing information, like above).
    
-   For public interface to get market data such as Get Kline data, Get Market Data Overview, Get Contract Information,Get market depth data, Get index kline, Get basis data, Get the last Trade of a Contract and so on：
    
    (1) For restful interfaces：all products(futures, coin margined swap, usdt margined Contracts ) 800 times/second for one IP at most
    
    （2）For websocket: The rate limit for “req” request is 50 times at once. No limit for “sub” request as the data will be pushed by sever voluntarily.
    
-   WebSocket, the private order push interface, requires API KEY Verification:
    
    Each UID can build at most create 30 WS connections for private order push at the same time. For each account, contracts of the same underlying coin only need to subscribe one WS order push, e.g. users only need to create one WS order push connection for BTC Contract which will automatically push orders of BTC weekly, BTC biweekly and BTC quarterlycontracts. Please note that the rate limit of WS order push and RESTFUL private interface are separated from each other, with no relations.
    
-   Both read and trade interfaces will return the ratelimit info.You can refer to the following fields of "header" from api response. E.g.,you will get the total Read ratelimit("ratelimit-limit") and the remaining Read ratelimit("ratelimit-remaining") when you query the order info(/api/v1/contract\_order\_info) , and you will get the total Trade ratelimit("ratelimit-limit") and the remaining Trade ratelimit("ratelimit-remaining") when you place an order(/api/v1/contract\_order)). [API Interface List](https://docs.huobigroup.com/docs/dm/v1/en/#api-list)
    
-   Will response following string for "header" via api:
    
    ratelimit-limit: the upper limit of requests per time, unit: times
    
    ratelimit-interval: reset interval (reset the number of request), unit: ms
    
    ratelimit-remaining: the left available request number for this round, unit: times
    
    ratelimit-reset: upper limit of reset time used to reset request number, unit: ms
    
    When API Limitation on Order Cancellation Ratio is triggered,the following string for "header" via api will also be returned:
    
    recovery-time: recovery timestamp, whose unit is millisecond, showing the end time of prohibition, or the access retrieval timestamp;
    
    if you are not in the prohibition period, the field is not included in returned header;

### API Limitation on Order Cancellation Ratio

-   The system will calculate the order cancellation ratio automatically when the total number of orders placed via certain order price types by the API user goes equal to or larger than 3,000 within 10 minutes. If the order cancellation ratio is greater than 99%, the user will be prohibited for 5 minutes from placing orders via certain API order price types which will be listed below (The response of placing orders will return: 1084 Your contract API is disabled, please try again after {0} (GMT+8).).
-   A 30-minute API order placement prohibition will be triggered if the user was prohibited for 3 times within an hour (The response of placing orders will return: 1084 Your contract API is disabled, please try again after {0} (GMT+8).). After resuming access, the total number of prohibited times will be cleared during the previous period and will not be counted into the total prohibited times in the new period.
-   Please note that the prohibition from placing orders will cause no effect on order cancellation via API as well as order placement and cancellation via other terminals. We’ll keep you notified on each prohibition via SMS and email.
-   Only four API order price types will be prohibited which are Limit order, Post\_only, FOK and IOC. Please note that you can still use freely other order price types during the banned period, such as Flash Close, BBO, Optimal 5, Optimal 10 and Optimal 20, opponent\_ioc, lightning\_ioc, optimal\_5\_ioc, optimal\_10\_ioc，optimal\_20\_ioc，opponent\_fok，lightning\_fok，optimal\_5\_fok，optimal\_10\_fok，optimal\_20\_fok,etc.
-   The response header returned by HTTP request:
    
    -   When placing order by using the four prohibited order price types during the prohibition period, the message header returned by interface will include the field:
    -   "recovery-time": recovery timestamp ,whose unit is millisecond, showing the end time of prohibition, or the access retrieval timestamp;
    -   if you are not in the prohibition period, the field is not included in returned header;
-   Please note that our system calculates order cancellation ratio according to UID and therefore, the master account UID and sub-accounts UIDs will be counted separately. The calculation period is 10 min/time(The start time starts at 00:00 and the end time is 00:10. Every 10 minutes is a cycle.).
    
-   Definition of Indicators：
    
    -   Order Cancellation Ratio =Total number of invalid cancellation / Total number of placed orders (all types of orders placed via API)
    -   Total number of placed order: Total number of placed orders refers to all orders placed via API which meet these requirements:
    -   1.the order type is placing orders (Order Type = 1),
    -   2.order price types include Limit Order, Post\_only, FOK and IOC.
    -   3.order creating time should be within the interval between 3 seconds before the start time of the calculation period and the end time of the calculation period.
    -   Total number of invalid cancellation:Total number of invalid cancellation refers to all cancellation orders placed via API which meet the requirements.
    -   the order type is placing orders (order Type=1),
    -   the order price types are Limit Order, post\_only, FOK and IOC.
    -   the order status is “Orders cancelled” (status=7).
    -   order with 0 fulfilled.
    -   the interval between order cancellation and placement should be less than or equal to 3 seconds.
    -   the order cancellation time should be within the calculation period.
-   In order to ensure stability and transaction performance of API, please try to reduce order cancellation rate and cancellation amount during peak periods to avoid frequent triggering of API restriction mechanism.Suggestions of reducing order cancellation rate are as below:
    
    -   1\. Set orders’ price to BBO prices as close as possible;
    -   2\. Prolong the interval properly between each order placement and cancellation;
    -   3\. Try to increase your amount for each order and reduce the frequency of order;
    -   4\. Try to improve your order fulfillment rate:
    -   （1）Please try to use order prices types that help more on order fulfillment in preference such as BBO, Optimal 5, Optimal 10, Optimal 20, Flash Close, opponent\_ioc, lightning\_ioc, optimal\_5\_ioc, optimal\_10\_ioc，optimal\_20\_ioc，opponent\_fok，lightning\_fok，optimal\_5\_fok，optimal\_10\_fok，optimal\_20\_fok, etc.
    -   （2）Try to use best bid/ask price when placing IOC orders, FOK orders and Post\_only orders.
    -   5\. Please try to extend your request polling cycle when implementing your strategy.

### API Best Practice

#### 1\. Query contract history orders interface: /api/v1/contract\_hisorders

-   To ensure timeliness and to reduce latency, users are highly recommended to get contract history orders information faster from server memory using interface “query contract order information” (URL: api/v1/contract\_order\_info).
    
-   For users who use interface “query contract history orders” (URL: /api/v1/contract\_hisorders), please enter as many query conditions as possible (including symbol, trade\_type（recommended to send “0” to query all）, type, status, create\_date). Besides, try not to enter a big integer in parameter “create\_date”. You are kindly suggested to query one-day data at a time.
    

#### 2\. Query contract match results interface: /api/v1/contract\_matchresults

-   To improve query performance and response speed, please enter as many querying conditions as possible (including symbol, trade\_type（recommended to send “0” to query all）, contract\_code, create\_date). Besides, try not to enter a big integer in parameter “create\_date”. You are kindly suggested to query one-day data at a time.

#### 3\. Query contract financial record interface: /api/v1/contract\_financial\_record

-   To improve query performance and response speed, please enter as many querying conditions as possible (including symbol, type(recommended to leave it blank to query all), create\_date). Besides, try not to enter a big integer in parameter “create\_date”. You are kindly suggested to query one-day data at a time.

#### 4\. Query contract order detail interface: /api/v1/contract\_order\_detail

-   When querying orders without parameter(such as the parameter: created\_at), the query result data may be delayed. It is recommended to pass the two parameters of the interface: created\_at (order timestamp) and order\_type (order type, default 1), the database will be directly queried, and the query results data will be more timely.
    
-   Querying condition “created\_at” uses 13-bit long type time stamp (including milliseconds). Querying performance will be improved when accurate time stamps are entered.
    
-   For example: the converted time stamp of "2019/10/18 10:26:22" is 1571365582123. The returned ts from interface “contract\_order” can be used as time stamp to query corresponding order. 0 is not allowed in parameter “created\_at”.
    

#### 5\. Query contract trigger order history orders interface:

-   /api/v1/contract\_trigger\_hisorders
    
-   To improve query performance and response speed, please enter as many parameters as possible (including symbol, contract\_code, trade\_type, status, create\_date). Besides, try not to enter a big integer in parameter “create\_date”. You are kindly suggested to query one-day data at a time.
    

#### 6\. WebSocket subscription to Market Depth data:

-   For acquiring market depth data within 150 steps, you are kindly suggested to use step0, step1, step2, step3, step4, step5, step14, step15；
    
-   For acquiring market depth data within 20 steps, you are kindly suggested to use step6, step7, step8, step9, step10, step11, step12, step13；
    
-   Since the large volume of pushing 150 steps data every 100ms, WebSocket disconnection may occur frequently if client’s network bandwidth is insufficient or the processing is not in time; therefore, we highly recommend users using step6, step7, step8, step9, step10, step11, step12, step13 to acquire 20 steps data. For instance, subscribing 20 steps data.
    

`{`

`"sub": "market.BTC_CQ.depth.step6",`

`"id": "id5"`

`}`

-   We also suggest that you subscribe incremental market depth data.orderbook event will be checked every 30ms. If there is no orderbook event, you will not receive any orderbook data.you HAVE TO maintain local orderbook data,such as updating your local orderbook bids and asks data.You can subscribe 20 or 150 unmerged data.

`{`

`"sub": "market.BTC_CQ.depth.size_20.high_freq",`

`"data_type":"incremental",`

`"id": "id1"`

`}`

#### 7\. Place order interface (URL: /api/v1/contract\_order) and place a batch of orders interface (URL:/api/v1/contract\_batchorder):

-   We recommend to fill in the parameter “client\_order\_id”(should be unique from user-side),which can help users to acquire order status and other order information according to the parameter “client\_order\_id" from
    
-   query order information interface (URL: /api/v1/contract\_order\_info ) when there is no returned information due to network or other problems.
    

#### 8\. The best deployment of program server

-   It is recommended that place the server in AWS Tokyo C zone and use the api.hbdm.vn domain, which can effectively reduce network disconnection and network timeout.

## Future API FAQ

### Access and Authentication

#### Q1: Is the API Key for future and spot the same ?

Yes. The future API key and spot API key are same. You can create API using the following link. [click here](https://www.hbg.com/zh-cn/apikey/)

#### Q2: Why are APIs disconnected or timeout?

1.  The network connection is unstable if the server locates in China mainland,it is suggested to invoke APIS from a server located in 1c area of AWS Tokyo.
    
2.  You can use api.btcgateway.pro to debug for domestic network.
    

#### Q3: Why is the websocket often disconnected?

It seems that most of the abnormal websocket issues (such as disconnect, websocket close )(websocket: close 1006 (abnormal closure))are caused by different network environment. The following measures can effectively reduce websocket issues.

It would be better if the server is located in 1c area of AWS Tokyo with url api.hbdm.vn and implement websocket re-connection mechanism. Both market heartbeat and order heartbeat should response with Pong with different format, following Websocket market heartbeat and account heartbeat requirement.[here](https://docs.huobigroup.com/docs/dm/v1/en/#websocket-heartbeat-and-authentication-interface)

#### Q4: What is the difference between api.hbdm.com and api.hbdm.vn?

The api.hbdm.vn uses AWS's CDN service. it should be more stable and faster for AWS users. The api.hbdm.com uses Cloudflare's CDN service.

#### Q5: What is the colocation service ? which attention points should we know ?

Actually ,colo corresponds to a vpc node, which directly connects to private network of HTX's future, so it will reduce the latency between the client and the HTX future server (bypassing the CDN)

HTX future and HTX swap have the same colo, so the domain name connecting the swap api and the future api are the same.

Note : Colo needs to use api.hbdm.com for signature(authentication) to avoid getting 403 error: Verification failure.

#### Q6: Why does signature verification return failure (403: Verification failure) ?

The signature process of future is similar to HTX Spot . In addition to the following precautions,please refer to the swap or spot demo to verify whether the signature is successful. Please check your own signature code after demo verification is successful. The coin margined swap code demo is [here](https://docs.huobigroup.com/docs/coin_margined_swap/v1/en/#code-demo). The future code demo is [here](https://docs.huobigroup.com/docs/dm/v1/en/#code-demo). The USDT Margined Contracts code demo is [here](https://docs.huobigroup.com/docs/usdt_swap/v1/en/#code-demo).

1.  Check if the API key is valid and copied correctly.
2.  Check if the IP is in whitelist
3.  Check if th timestamp is UTC time
4.  Check if parameters are sorted alphabetically
5.  Check if the encoding is UTF-8
6.  Check if the signature has base64 encoding
7.  Any method with parameters for GET requests should be signed.
8.  Any method with parameters for POST requests don't need to be signed.
9.  Check if whether the signature is URI encoded and Hexadecimal characters must be capitalized, such as ":" should be encoded as "%3A", and the space should be encoded as "%20"
10.  The authorization of websocket is similar to the authorization of restful interface.Pls note that the json body of the websocket authorization shouldn't be URL encoded.
11.  The host in signature text should be the same as the host in your API request.The proxy may change the request host, you can try without proxy;Some http/websocket library may include port in the host, you can try to append port in signature host, like "api.hbdm.com:443"
12.  The hidden text in API Key and Secret Key may have impact on the signature.
13.  Check the byte\[\] is directly to be Base64 encoded after generated from the HmacSHA256 signature, instead of hexadecimal string to be Base64 encoded.

If the reason for signature failure has not been found through the above methods. And you can confirm that by this [demo](https://github.com/hbdmapi/huobi_api_rules) which is specially explaining the signature.

#### Q7: Is the ratelimit of public market based on IP ? Is the ratelimit of interface with private key based on UID?

Yes. The ratelimit of interface with private key is based on the UID, not the API key. The master and sub accounts are separately ratelimited and don't affect each other.

#### Q8: Is there any recommendation for third-party framework which integrates HTX future?

There is an open source asynchronous quantization framework which integrates HTX future and HTX swap: [here](https://github.com/hbdmapi/hbdm_Python). If you have any quetsions, please open a ticket in github issues.

### Delivery and Settlement

#### Q1: What is the future settlement cycle? Which interface can be used to check the status when the future is settled?

Orders can't be placed or cancelled during settlement period, error code "1056" will be returned if users place or cancel orders.

You are recommended to request contract information by this two ways:

-   restful, every few seconds during settlement period to access: /api/v1/contract\_contract\_info.
-   websocket, Subscribe Contract Info (no authentication): public.\$symbol.contract\_info

It's in settlement time if there is any number of 5, 6, 7, 8 included in the returned status code of contract\_status, while it indicates that settlement completed and users could place and cancel orders as usual if the returned status code is 1.

Kindly remind you that the delivery contract will be settled every day at 16:00 Singapore time or be deliveried at 16:00 on Friday. Inquiry about funds and positions during settlement or delivery will return an error code.

Error codes and their meaning are as following:

1.  Error code "1077" indicates that "the fund query of current perpetual swap trading pair failed during the settlement";
2.  Error code "1078" indicates that "the fund query of part of perpetual swap trading pairs failed during the settlement";
3.  Error code "1079" indicates that "the position query of current perpetual swap trading pair failed during the settlement";
4.  Error code "1080" indicates that "the position query of part of perpetual swap trading pairs failed during the settlement";

You are recommended to read the status code from the returned message. If the above four types of status code appear, the returned data is not accurate and couldn't be used as reference.

#### Q2: How to query the system status of the exchange?

There are two common statuses of the exchange systems: settlement/delivery in progress; suspended for maintenance; when the system is in these two kinds of statuses, the system will return the response error code and error information when calling the related API interfaces.

a. How to judge whether the settlement/delivery has been done?

Users can judge from the value “contract\_status” returned by the “Get Information of an Order” interface ( /api/v1/contract\_contract\_info)

or Subscribe Contract Info (no authentication): public.\$symbol.contract\_info

If the return parameter contract\_status is 1, it means that the settlement/delivery has been done and the trading has been resumed now.

b. How to judge whether the system is suspended for maintenance or not?

Users can judge from the value “heartbeat” pushed by the “Queried if system interface is available” interface (https://api.hbdm.com/heartbeat/)

or the “Subscribe system status updates” interface ("topic: public.\$service.heartbeat");

If the return parameter heartbeat is 1, it means that the system is available now and can be connected normally.

### Market and Websocket

#### Q1: How often are the snapshot orderbook subscription and incremental orderbook subscription pushed?

The snapshot orderbook subscription(market.\$symbol.depth.\$type) is checked once every 100MS.If there is an update,it will be pushed. It will be pushed at least 1 second.The incremental orderbook subscription is checked once every 30MS.If there is an update,it will be pushed.If there is no update, it will not be pushed.

#### Q2: How often is the market trade subscription pushed?

The market trade subscription will be pushed when there is a transaction.

#### Q3: Are there historical Kline data or historical market trade data?

The historical kline data can be obtained via API interface /market/history/kline with the request params from, to (the time period cannot exceed two years). And the qty of data records cannot be exceeding 2000 in each time.

The historical trade data can be obtained by subscribing the websocket topic: market.\$symbol.trade.detail

or can be downloaded from [download historical market data](https://futures.huobi.be/zh-cn/data/landing_page)

But also, you can download that data using [The demo of downloading historical market data](https://github.com/hbdmapi/huobi_public_data)

#### Q4: How to get MACD and other technical indicators on Kline?

The API does not have interfaces to get technical indicators such as MACD. You can refer to TradingView and other websites to calculate them.

#### Q5: What is the definition of timestamp in the document?

The timestamp in the document refers to the total number of seconds or total milliseconds from Greenwich Mean Time, January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 (Beijing Time, January 1, 1970, 08:00:00) to the present.

#### Q6: What is the definition of the 150 level and 20 level of MBP?

The Subscription of MBP data: market.\$symbol.depth.\$type.150 price level means the current bids and asks splited into 150 level by price.20 price level means the current bids and asks splited into 20 level by price.

#### Q7: What is the meaning of merged depth when subscribing MBP data?

The subscrpition of MBP data:market.\$symbol.depth.\$type：

step1 and step7 are merged by 5 decimal places.bids down,asks up.step2 and step8 are merged by 4 decimal places.bids down,asks up.step3 and step9 are merged by 3 decimal places.bids down,asks up.step4 and step10 are merged by 2 decimal places.bids down,asks up.step5 and step11 are merged by 1 decimal places.bids down,asks up.step12 and step14 are combined by single digit.bids down,asks up.step13 and step15 are combined by tens.bids down,asks up.

Example:

step4(0.01):

bids price: 100.123, 100.245.The merged bids price are 100.12, 100.24.

asks price: 100.123, 100.245The merged asks price are 100.13, 100.25.

("Down" and "Up" are rounded up or down, if the price is down, the asks price is not rounded down, and the bids price is rounded up.)

150 price level: step0 to step5, step14, step15；

20 price level: step6 to step13;

More examples：

step1(0.00001):

price: 1.123456The merged bid price is 1.12345.The merged ask price is 1.12346.

step7(0.00001):

price: 1.123456The merged bid price is 1.12345.The merged ask price is 1.12346.

step6(0.000001)

price: 1.123456The merged bid price is 1.123456.The merged ask price is 1.123456.

step11(0.1):

price: 1.123456The merged bid price is 1.1.The merged ask price is 1.1.

#### Q8:Does websocket's position channel push full data or incrementall data each time?

Subscription of position event: "positions.btc".The latest position is pushed,including the volumes, available volumes, frozen volumes.If there is no update,it will not be pushed.

#### Q9: Does websocket's position channel push data when the unrealized profit is updated?

Subscription of position event: "positions.btc".It will not be pushed if only unrealized profit is updated.It will be pushed only when position event is updated.

#### Q10: What is the difference between market detail and trade detail in WS?

Market Detail(market.\$symbol.detail) is the merged market data. It will be checked every 0.5s, pushed once trade event udpates,including the OHLCV data,etc.Trade Detail(market.\$symbol.trade.detail) is pushed once trade event updates,including trade price, trade volume, trade direction,etc.

#### Q11: What is the meaning of the two ts pushed by subscription of incremental MBP ?

Subscription of incremental MBP：market.\$symbol.depth.size\_\${size}.high\_freq，The outer ts is the timestamp when the market server sends the data.The inner ts is the timestamp when the orderbook is checked.

#### Q12: What is the difference between websocket subscription of MBP and incremental MBP? How often is the incremental MBP pushed?

market.\$symbol.depth.\$type is snapshot MBP data，market.\$symbol.depth.size\_\${size}.high\_freq is incremental MBP data.Snapshot MBP data is checked every 100ms,pushed at least every 1s.Incremental MBP data is checked every 30ms.It will not be pushed,if MBP has no update.

#### Q13: How to maintain local MBP data subscribing incremental MBP:market.\$symbol.depth.size\_\${size}.high\_freq?

Snapshot MBP data will be pushed for the first time, and the incremental MBP data will be pushed afterwards.

(1) Compare the incremental price with the previous full MBP data, and replace the order amount with the same price;

(2) If the price is not in the local MBP data,add the price to the local MBP data;

(3) If a price level is gone, data such as \[8100, 0\] will be pushed.You have to remove the same price of local MBP data;

(4) For the same websocket connection, the incremental data version is incremented; if the version is not incremented, you need to re-subscribe and re-maintain the local full MBP data;

#### Q14: Will the quarter contract of the delivery contract be converted to the next week contract, will it be notified or changged by WS?

If a quarterly contract such as BTC\_CQ is converted to the next week contract BTC\_NW, WS will not automatically notify you, you need to change the subscription to BTC\_NW.

#### Q15: When subscribing the same topic of several contract codes, will several ws be needed?

Since Futures, Coin Margined swaps, USDT Margined Contracts are different contracts with different interface addresses, different ws will be needed.

In Futures, Coin Margined swaps, USDT Margined Contracts thereof, as long as the interface address is the same, one ws is enough.

#### Q16: Is it available to place/cancel an order via WS??

Currently, it is not supported.

#### Q17: How to subscribe order status?

a. Successfully trade: “Subscribe Match Order Data (matchOrders.\$symbol)” or “Subscribe Order Data (orders.\$symbol)”

b. Successfully cancel: Subscribe Account Equity Updates Data (accounts.\$symbol)

#### Q18: What is the difference between the “Subscribe Match Order Data (matchOrders.\$symbol)” and “Subscribe Order Data (orders.\$symbol)”?

The pushed data of these two interfaces are different. Compared to “Subscribe Match Order Data (matchOrders.\$symbol)”, there are more fields for “Subscribe Order Data (orders.\$symbol)”

In general, the match order data (Subscribe Match Order Data “matchOrders.\$symbol”) may be pushed faster than the settled order data (Subscribe Order Data “orders.\$symbol”).

The orders of forced liquidation and netting will not be pushed in “Subscribe Match Order Data (matchOrders.\$symbol)”

#### Q19: How often is the “Subscribe Kline Data (market.\$symbol.kline.\$period)” pushed?

If any transaction is completed, it will push every 500ms. If not, it will push according to the subscribe period

#### Q20: How to judge whether the push is delayed?

Please first synchronize the time of the server through https://api.hbdm.com/api/v1/timestamp), and the “ts” in the returned data is timestamp (ms) and the corresponding time zone is UTC+8.

The outer layer of each pushed data has a “ts”, which represents the time stamp (ms) when the server pushes the data to the client and the corresponding time zone is UTC+8.

When the data pushed arrive, the procedure will record the local time “ts”. When the local time “ts” is much later than the pushing data “ts”, you can use the following methods to improve the delay:

a. Reduce the data pushed by reducing the number of WS subscriptions.

b. Check the stability and speed of the network between procedure and the servers (please replace api.btcgateway.pro with the domain name used by the program)

curl -o /dev/null -s -w time\_namelookup"(s)":%{time\_namelookup}"\\n"time\_connect"(s)":%{time\_connect}"\\n"time\_starttransfer"(s)":%{time\_starttransfer}"\\n"time\_total"(s)":%{time\_total}"\\n"speed\_download"(B/s)":%{speed\_download}"\\n" api.btcgateway.pro

and you will receive data as below:

time\_namelookup(s):0.001378

time\_connect(s):0.128641

time\_starttransfer(s):0.276588

time\_total(s):0.276804

speed\_download(B/s):2010.000

If you run the above command multiple times in a row, and the results obtained each time are very different, you can: a. Select an appropriate HTX domain name, b. Optimize or reselect the network where the program is located.

### Order and Trade

#### Q1: What's the reason for 1004 error code?

We notice that the system is sometimes overloaded when the market suddenly turns to be highly volatile. If the system is busy recently or the following prompts appear:

{“status”: “error”, “err\_code”: 1004, “err\_msg”: “System busy. Please try again later.”, “ts”:}

please be patient, and do not place or cancel order repeatedly during the process to avoid repeated orders and additional pressure on system performance. In the meanwhile, it is recommended to place and cancel orders through Web and APP.

#### Q2: The same order ID and match ID can have multiple trades. for example: if a user take a large amount of maker orders, there will be multiple corresponding trades . How to identify these different trades ?

The field ID returned by the information interface /api/v1/contract\_order\_detail is a globally unique transaction identifier. if a maker order is matched multiple times, a trade will be pushed once there is a transaction matched.

#### Q3: What is the delay for the round trip of HTX future?

At present,it normally takes about 30-50ms from placing the order to getting the status of the order.

#### Q4: Why does the API return connection reset or Max retris or Timeout error?

Most of the network connectivity problems ,(such as Connection reset or network timeout ) are caused by network instability , you can use the server in AWS Tokyo C area with api.hbdm.vn , which can effectively reduce network timeout errors.

#### Q5: How to check the order status without order\_id not returned?

If the order\_id couldn't be returned due to network problems, you can query the status of the order by adding the custom order number(client\_order\_id ).

#### Q6: What to do if it's diconnected after the websocket subscription of account, order and positions for a while?

When subscribing private accounts, orders and positions, the heartbeat should also be maintained regularly ,which is different from the market heartbeat format . Please refer to the ["websocket Heartbeat and Authentication Interface"](https://docs.huobigroup.com/docs/dm/v1/en/#websocket-heartbeat-and-authentication-interface) . if the it is disconnected ,please try to reconnect.

#### Q7: What is the difference between order status 1 and 2 ? what is the status 3 ?

Status 1 is the preparation for submission. status 2 is the sequential submission of internal process, which can be considered that it has been accepted by the system. Status 3 indicated that the order has been already submitted to market.

#### Q8: Is there an interface to get the total assets in BTC of my account ?

No.

#### Q9: Why is the order filled after the order is withdrawed successfully by placing API cancellation ?

The success return of order cancellation or placement only represents that the command is excuted successfully and doesn't mean that the order has been cancelled . You can check the order status through the interface /api/v1/contract\_order\_info.

#### Q10: How long does it generally take for an API from withdrawing to cancelling successfully ?

The order cancellation command generally takes several tens of ms. The actual status of order cancellation can be obtained by invoking the interface: /api/v1/contract\_order\_info.

#### Q11: How to get historical liquidation orders?

To obtain historical liquidation orders, you can access the one of four api interfaces: Get History Orders (/api/v1/contract\_hisorders), Get History Match Results (/api/v1/contract\_matchresults), Query history orders via multiple fields (/api/v1/contract\_hisorders\_exact), Query history transactions via multiple fields (/api/v1/contract\_matchresults\_exact), with the return field order\_source (order source) to judge. When order\_source returns "risk", it means that this order is a liquidated order.

#### Q12: Why can't open positions?

1.  Available margin is not enough to open positions, cause we have the minimum amount requirements when open positions.
2.  The order price is out of the range of price limits.
3.  The amount exceeds the upper limit of single orders.
4.  The number of positions exceed the upper limit for an individual investor.
5.  Positions may only be closed within 10 min before settlement.(error code 1105)
6.  The positions are taken over by system.

#### Q13: Does Huob Futures support holding bi-directional position?

Yes, HTX Futures supports long and short positions being held at the same time.

#### Q14: How to ensure the order to be rapidly filled?

At present, HTX Futures does not support market price when placing an order. To increase the probability of a transaction, users can choose to place an order based on BBO price (opponent), optimal 5 (optimal\_5), optimal 10 (optimal\_10), optimal 20 (optimal\_20), among which the success probability of optimal 20 is the largest, while the slippage always is the largest as well.

It is important to note that the above methods will not guarantee the order to be filled in 100%. The system will obtain the optimal N price at that moment and place the order.

#### Q15: How can API procedure be connected to the exchange more rapidly?

It’s recommended to use a AWS Tokyo c-zone server and the domain name “api.hbdm.vn” to connect to the system.

#### Q16: It occurs an “abnormal service” error when transferring assets between spots and derivatives.

a. Check whether the request address is the address of HTX: api.huobi.pro?

b. Check whether the precision of the coin does not exceed 8 decimal places?

#### Q17: How to confirm whether the position is opened or closed successfully?

Placing an order successfully through “Place an Order” interface (/api/v1/contract\_order) or “Place a batch of orders” interface (/api/v1/contract\_batchorder) just means the server has received your order placing instructions rather than you have opened/closed a position successfully.

You can check the order status by filling the returned “order\_id” in the “Get Information of an Order” interface (/api/v1/contract\_order\_info) or the “Order Details Acquisition” interface (/api/v1/contract\_order\_detail); If the order has been filled, the “status” value in the return parameter will turn out 6 (wholly filled)

It is important to note:

a. For “Get Information of an order” interface (/api/v1/contract\_order\_info), after the settlement or delivery, the system will delete all the orders in ended status (5: partially filled orders have been cancelled; 6: wholly filled; 7: cancelled);

b. There is a delay in “Order Details Acquisition” interface (/api/v1/contract\_order\_detail), so it is better to fill in “created\_at” (order timestamp) and “order\_type” (order type, fill in 1 by default). In this way, it will directly query the database, so the query results will be more timely.

#### Q18: Why are orders canceled by the system automatically?

The order\_price\_type which can be chosen are IOC, FOK and Maker (Post Only). When the order book cannot meet with the corresponding conditions, the system will cancel the orders automatically:

Post\_only: If the order placed is filled with an existing order on the order book immediately, the order will be cancelled to ensure the user is always a maker.

IOC order: If the order cannot be filled immediately, the unfilled part will be cancelled at once;

FOK order: If the order cannot be filled in its entirety, it will be wholly cancelled. No partial fulfillments are allowed.

#### Q19: How to query the maximum amount (cont) available to open by using users’ current assets?

At present, we do not have an interface by which users can directly query the maximum amount (cont) available to open by using users’ the current asset.

#### Q20: Are the “order\_id” and “order\_id\_str” the same?

The “order\_id\_str” is the string format of “order\_id”, whose values are the same.

For the “order\_id” with 18 bits, the “JSON.parse” in “nodejs” and “javascript” will be “int” by default, and mistakes will occur when analyzing. Thus, we advise using “order\_id\_str”.

#### Q21: How to get the active buying/selling quantity in transaction data?

Users can get the data via “Query The Last Trade of a Contract” (/market/trade) interface or by subscribing "sub": "market.\$contract\_code.trade.detail", thereinto

Amount refers to the trading volume (cont), which is the sum of the buying/selling volume;

Direction refers to the active trading direction.

#### Q22: The interval between “from” and “to” is “2000\*period” when acquiring KLine data, then why the data obtained is \[\]?

When acquiring the Kline data, the two time points “from” and “to” are contained, therefore it includes 2001 pieces of data. However, this exceeds the maximum limit 2000. Therefore, the system will return \[\].

Besides, the returned data will be \[\] as well if the interval between “from” and “to” exceeds 2 years.

#### Q23: How to get the latest price?

There are two methods to get the latest price:

a. Invoking the “Get KLine Data” interface and filling in any “period”, the “close” of the last data in return data will be the latest price;

b. Invoking the “Query The Last Trade of a Contract” interface, the returned “price” will be the latest price.

#### Q24: How to get the latest index price?

There are two methods to get the latest index price:

a. Calling the “Get Contract Index Price Information” interface (/api/v1/contract\_index), the returned “index\_price” will be the latest index price.

b. Calling the “Subscribe Index Kline Data” websocket (market.\$symbol.index.\$period), the “close” of the last Kline data in returned data will be the latest index price.

#### Q25: Will API upgrade affect the operation of the program?

In general, API upgrade will partly influence the ws disconnection. To avoid this, you can set up a ws-reconnect mechanism in advance; Please subscribe to the upgrade announcements for more details:

Coin-margined futures: https://status-dm.huobigroup.com/

Coin-margined swaps: https://status-swap.huobigroup.com/

USDT-margined contracts: https://status-linear-swap.huobigroup.com/

#### Q26: What does mean the “margin\_balance” in “Query User’s Account Information” interface (api/v1/contract\_account\_info)?

”margin\_balance” refers to the account equity

1.  margin\_balance = margin\_static + profit\_unreal
    
2.  margin\_balance = Account balance + profit\_real + profit\_unreal
    

Note: Account balance = margin\_static - profit\_real, there is only margin\_static in the return data of api interface

Each of the two calculation methods above can get the margin\_balance

#### Q27: Is the “risk\_rate” (margin rate) in “Query User’s Account Information” interface (/api/v1/contract\_account\_info) the same as the margin rate on WEB?

Yes, it is

When the “risk\_rate” is less than or equal to 0, the position will be liquidated.

### Error Codes

#### Q1: What is the reason for 1030 error code?

If you encounter errors such as {"status":"error","err\_code":1030,"err\_msg":"Abnormal service. Please try again later.","ts":1588093883199},indicating that your input request parameter is not correct, please print your request body and complete URL parameters, and please check the corresponding API document interface one by one.The common example is that the volume must be an integer, and the client\_order\_id must be of type uint32 rather than type uint64.

#### Q2: What is the reason for 1048 error code?

If you encounter errors such as {'index': 1, 'err\_code': 1048, 'err\_msg': 'Insufficient close amount available.'}, indicating that your available position is not enough.You need to query the api api/v1/contract\_position\_info to get your available position.

1.  Check whether the amount (cont) of position-closing order exceeds the limit? (When there is limit order for closing a position, the quantity that available to be closed will be occupied; hence we kindly remind you to cancel these orders and try again.)
    
2.  Check whether direction and offset are wrong as follows:
    

close long: sell to close a long position (direction: sell; offset: close);

close short: buy to close a short position (direction: buy; offset: close);

Only “direction” need to be uploaded when placing a flash close order (close long: sell; close short: buy).

1.  The pending take-profit and stop-loss (tp/sl) orders and trigger orders will not occupy the quantity of the position.

#### Q3: What is the reason for 1032 error code?

1032 means that your request exceeds the ratelimit. The coin margined swap, future and USDT margined Contracts limit the rate separately. Please check the ratelimit in the api ratelimit instructions, and you can print the current ratelimit in the header of the API response to check whether the ratelimit is exceeded. It is recommended to increase the request interval delay to avoid exceeding the ratelimit.

### How to solve problems more effectively?

When you report an API error, you need to attach your request URL, the original complete body of the request and the complete request URL parameters, and the original complete log of the server's response. If it is a websocket subscription, you need to provide the address of the subscription, the topic of the subscription, and the original complete log pushed by the server.

If it is an order-related issue, use the API order query interface /api/v1/contract\_order\_info to keep the complete log returned and provide your UID and order number.

### /api/v1/contract-cancel-after ( Automatic Order Cancellation)

Request type: POST

Signature verification: Yes

Interface permission: Trade

Interface description: Huobi Futures launches the automatic order cancellation interface to prevent API users from incurring unexpected losses in the event of network failures or client system failures that result in a loss of communication with the Huobi system. When users experience an unexpected disconnection from Huobi's system, this interface automatically cancels all pending orders (including both opening and closing orders) to mitigate potential losses through its Dead Man's Switch functionality. If the interface is not called again within the specified period, all of the user's pending futures orders will be canceled.

Notes:

If there is a number in the Contract Code row，inquiry with Contract\_Code.

If there is no number，inquiry by Symbol + Contract Type.

"limit"，"post\_only"，"ioc" and "fok" the four order price type need price value and the other don't need.

Post-Only orders are limit orders that will never take liquidity (also called maker-only order). There are order limit and position for post-only orders which the upper limit is 500,000 for open/close orders under weekly, bi-weekly and quarterly contract respectively.

If you’re holding a position currently, the leverage you choose when placing an order should be the same as the leverage of your current positions, otherwise, the order will fail to be placed. If you need a new leverage to place an order, you should switch the leverage of current positions first by using the Switch Leverage interface.

Only open orders can support setting take profit and stop loss.

The take profit trigger price is a required field for setting a take profit order, and the stop loss trigger price is a required field for setting a stop loss order; if the trigger price field is not filled in, the corresponding take profit order or stop loss order will not be set.

Description of post\_only: assure that the maker order remains as maker order, it will not be filled immediately with the use of post\_only, for the match system will automatically check whether the price of the maker order is higher/lower than the opponent first price, i.e. higher than bid price 1 or lower than the ask price 1. If yes, the maker order will placed on the orderbook, if not, the maker order will be cancelled.

open long: direction - buy、offset - open

close long: direction -sell、offset - close

open short: direction -sell、offset - open

close short: direction -buy、offset - close

No need to transfer BBO order price(ask 1 and bid 1) parameter, optimal\_5: top 5 optimal BBO price, optimal\_10：top 10 optimal BBO price, optimal\_20：top 20 optimal BBO price (No need to transfer price data) ，limit": limit order, "post\_only": maker order only (price data transfer is needed),IOC :Immediate-Or-Cancel Order,FOK:Fill-Or-Kill Order.

Risk Reminder:By using Best Bid/Offer( bbo ), you are to place limit orders at the best prices offered by the opposite side. In the event of extreme volatility or insufficient liquidity，there is a risk that your orders may not be filled in full. Any unfilled part will remain open in the market pending further execution. Selecting BBO means you understand how this order type is executed and acknowledge to bear the risk of incomplete execution.

#### Response Parameter

Notes:

The return order\_id is 18 bits, it will make mistake when nodejs and JavaScript analysed 18 bits. Because the Json.parse in nodejs and JavaScript is int by default. so the number over 18 bits need be parsed by jaso-bigint package.

Notes:

If there is a number in the Contract Code row,inquiry with Contract\_Code.

If there is no number,inquiry by Symbol + Contract Type.

"limit"，"post\_only"，"ioc" and "fok" the four order price type need price value and the other don't need.

Description of post\_only: assure that the maker order remains as maker order, it will not be filled immediately with the use of post\_only, for the match system will automatically check whether the price of the maker order is higher/lower than the opponent first price, i.e. higher than bid price 1 or lower than the ask price 1. If yes, the maker order will placed on the orderbook, if not, the maker order will be cancelled.

If you’re holding a position currently, the leverage you choose when placing an order should be the same as the leverage of your current positions, otherwise, the order will fail to be placed. If you need a new leverage to place an order, you should switch the leverage of current positions first by using the Switch Leverage interface.

Only open orders can support setting take profit and stop loss.

The take profit trigger price is a required field for setting a take profit order, and the stop loss trigger price is a required field for setting a stop loss order; if the trigger price field is not filled in, the corresponding take profit order or stop loss order will not be set.

No need to transfer BBO order price(ask 1 and bid 1) parameter, optimal\_5: top 5 optimal BBO price, optimal\_10：top 10 optimal BBO price, optimal\_20：top 20 optimal BBO price (No need to transfer price data) ，limit": limit order, "post\_only": maker order only (price data transfer is needed),IOC :Immediate-Or-Cancel Order,FOK:Fill-Or-Kill Order

Risk Reminder:By using Best Bid/Offer( bbo ), you are to place limit orders at the best prices offered by the opposite side. In the event of extreme volatility or insufficient liquidity，there is a risk that your orders may not be filled in full. Any unfilled part will remain open in the market pending further execution. Selecting BBO means you understand how this order type is executed and acknowledge to bear the risk of incomplete execution.

Notes:

The return order\_id is 18 bits, it will make mistake when nodejs and JavaScript analysed 18 bits. Because the Json.parse in nodejs and JavaScript is int by default. so the number over 18 bits need be parsed by jaso-bigint package.

Notes:

When getting information on order cancellation via query order detail interface, users who type in parameters “created\_at” and “order\_type” can query last 6-hour data, while users who don’t type in parameters “created\_at” and “order\_type” can only query last 2-hour data.

The return order\_id is 18 bits, it will make mistake when nodejs and JavaScript analysed 18 bits. Because the Json.parse in nodejs and JavaScript is int by default. so the number over 18 bits need be parsed by jason-bigint package.

created\_at should use timestamp of long type as 13 bits (include Millisecond), if send the accurate timestamp for "created\_at", query performance will be improved.

eg. the timestamp "2019/10/18 10:26:22" can be changed：1571365582123.It can also directly obtain the timestamp（ts) from the returned ordering interface(contract\_order) to query the corresponding orders.

Please note that created\_at can't be "0"

| direct | string | false | Query direction | prev ；next ；Default value：prev |  |

Notes:

Value range description of start\_time and end\_time:

start\_time: value range is \[(current time - 90 days)，current time\] ；default value is clamp（end\_time - 10 days，current time -90 days，current time -10 days）which means the furthest time is the current time minus 90 days and the most recent time is current time minus 10 days.

end\_time: value range is \[(current day - 90 days)，above++)，if the end\_time is greater than the current time, use current time; if start\_time is filled，the end\_time shall be greater than start\_time. The system will use current time by default.

if from\_id is not filled and the query direction is prev, query from back to front from the end time; if from\_id is not filled and the query direction is next, query from front to back from the start time. Query financial records with creation time greater than or equal to the start time but less than or equal to the end time.

Regardless the query direction is prev or next, the data returned is reverse sorted by query\_id.

If the value of start\_time or end\_time filled in is not within the value range, the system will report that the parameter is invalid.

Only data within 90 days are available to query.

| DATA\_END |  | false |  |  |
| ts | long | true | timestamp |  |

Notes:

if the query result exceeds the data limit, next\_id is the id of next data. ( when the query direction is prev, next\_id presents the first data on the next page; when the query direction is next, next\_id presents the last data on the next page.)

The real\_profit is calculated with the average price in open position and the transaction average price in close position (the real profit is the sum of each profit of order matched).

Only the real profit parameter (real\_profit) of the transaction information that orders created after 0:00 on January 30, 2021 has a value . And of the other order transaction information that orders created before that times, the real profit parameter is 0.
