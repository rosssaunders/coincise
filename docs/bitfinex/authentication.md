## REST Authentication Details

### 

Authentication

[](#authentication)

Authenticated endpoints require users to sign their requests using a pair of API-KEY and API-SECRET. Below you can find several guides to authenticate your HTTP requests using different programming languages. These examples use the [Submit Order](/reference/rest-auth-submit-order) endpoint but can be easily modified to make requests to other endpoints.

[Examples for more programming languages can be found here.](/recipes)
