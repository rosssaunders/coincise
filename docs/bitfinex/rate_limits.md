Rate Limits

In order to offer the best service possible, there is a rate limit to the number
of REST requests that can be made in the span of a minute. Our rate limit policy
varies per endpoint and lies in the range of 10 to 90 requests per minute. For
more information regarding the requirements and limitations of our API, please
look to our [Requirements and Limitations](/docs/requirements-and-limitations)
page.
