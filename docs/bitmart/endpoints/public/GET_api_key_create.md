## API Key Create

-   Many APIs require an API Access Key for access. Please refer to [this page](https://www.bitmart.com/open-api-guide/en-US) to set up.
-   When setting up an API Access Key, it is recommended to set up an IP access whitelist for security purposes.
-   Never give your API Access key/secret key to anyone.

If you accidentally leak your API key, delete it immediately and generate a new one.

#### After creating an API Key, you will receive three pieces of information that you must remember:

-   `Access Key`: represents the identity of the account, this is your api key
-   `Secret Key`: used for API signature
-   `Memo`: used for API signature

The Access Key and Secret Key will be randomly generated and provided by BitMart, and the Memo will be provided by you to ensure the security of API access.
