## Query order (USER\_DATA)​

```
GET /api/v3/order
```

Check an order's status.

**Weight:** 4

**Parameters:**

| Name | Type | Mandatory | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| symbol | STRING | YES |  |
| orderId | LONG | NO |  |
| origClientOrderId | STRING | NO |  |
| recvWindow | DECIMAL | NO | The value cannot be greater than `60000`.  
Supports up to three decimal places of precision (e.g., 6000.346) so that microseconds may be specified. |
| timestamp | LONG | YES |  |

**Notes:**

-   Either `orderId` or `origClientOrderId` must be sent.
-   If both `orderId` and `origClientOrderId` are provided, the `orderId` is searched first, then the `origClientOrderId` from that result is checked against that order. If both conditions are not met the request will be rejected.
-   For some historical orders `cummulativeQuoteQty` will be < 0, meaning the data is not available at this time.
