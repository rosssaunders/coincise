**Weight:** 1

**Parameters:**

| Name               | Type   | Mandatory | Description                                                                |
| ------------------ | ------ | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| symbol             | STRING | YES       |                                                                            |
| orderId            | LONG   | NO        |                                                                            |
| origClientOrderId  | STRING | NO        |                                                                            |
| newClientOrderId   | STRING | NO        | Used to uniquely identify this cancel. Automatically generated by default. |
| cancelRestrictions | ENUM   | NO        | Supported values:                                                          |

`ONLY_NEW` - Cancel will succeed if the order status is `NEW`.  
`ONLY_PARTIALLY_FILLED` \- Cancel will succeed if order status is
`PARTIALLY_FILLED`. | | recvWindow | DECIMAL | NO | The value cannot be greater
than `60000`.  
Supports up to three decimal places of precision (e.g., 6000.346) so that
microseconds may be specified. | | timestamp | LONG | YES | |

Notes:

- Either `orderId` or `origClientOrderId` must be sent.
- If both `orderId` and `origClientOrderId` are provided, the `orderId` is
  searched first, then the `origClientOrderId` from that result is checked
  against that order. If both conditions are not met the request will be
  rejected.

**Data Source:** Matching Engine

**Response:**

```
{  "symbol": "LTCBTC",  "origClientOrderId": "myOrder1",  "orderId": 4,  "orderListId": -1, // Unless it's part of an order list, value will be -1  "clientOrderId": "cancelMyOrder1",  "transactTime": 1684804350068,  "price": "2.00000000",  "origQty": "1.00000000",  "executedQty": "0.00000000",  "origQuoteOrderQty": "0.000000",  "cummulativeQuoteQty": "0.00000000",  "status": "CANCELED",  "timeInForce": "GTC",  "type": "LIMIT",  "side": "BUY",  "selfTradePreventionMode": "NONE"}
```

**Notes:**

- The payload above does not show all fields that can appear in the order
  response. Please refer to
  [Conditional fields in Order Responses](/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/rest-api/trading-endpoints#conditional-fields-in-order-responses).
- The performance for canceling an order (single cancel or as part of a
  cancel-replace) is always better when only `orderId` is sent. Sending
  `origClientOrderId` or both `orderId` + `origClientOrderId` will be slower.

**Regarding `cancelRestrictions`**

- If the `cancelRestrictions` value is not any of the supported values, the
  error will be:

```
{    "code": -1145,    "msg": "Invalid cancelRestrictions"}
```

- If the order did not pass the conditions for `cancelRestrictions`, the error
  will be:

```
{    "code": -2011,    "msg": "Order was not canceled due to cancel restrictions."}
```
