## General Info

### General API Information

- The base endpoint is: **[https://papi.binance.com](https://papi.binance.com)**
- All endpoints return either a JSON object or raw primitive.
- Data is returned in ascending order. Oldest first, newest last.
- All time and timestamp related fields are in UTC milliseconds.
- All data types adopt definition in JAVA.

#### HTTP Return Codes

- HTTP `4XX` return codes are used for for malformed requests; the issue is on
  the sender's side.
- HTTP `403` return code is used when the WAF Limit (Web Application Firewall)
  has been violated.
- HTTP `429` return code is used when breaking a request rate limit.
- HTTP `418` return code is used when an IP has been auto-banned for continuing
  to send requests after receiving `429` codes.
- HTTP `5XX` return codes are used for internal errors; the issue is on
  Binance's side.
  1.  If there is an error message "Request occur unknown error.", please retry
      later.
- HTTP `503` return code is used when:
  1.  If there is an error message "Unknown error, please check your request or
      try again later." returned in the response, the API successfully sent the
      request but not get a response within the timeout period.It is important
      to NOT treat this as a failure operation; the execution status is UNKNOWN
      and could have been a success;
  2.  If there is an error message "Service Unavailable." returned in the
      response, it means this is a failure API operation and the service might
      be unavailable at the moment, you need to retry later.
  3.  If there is an error message "Internal error; unable to process your
      request. Please try again." returned in the response, it means this is a
      failure API operation and you can resend your request if you need.
  4.  If the response contains the error message **"Request throttled by
      system-level protection. Reduce-only/close-position orders are exempt.
      Please try again." (-1008)**, This indicates the node has exceeded its
      maximum concurrency and is temporarily throttled. Close-position,
      reduce-only, and cancel orders are exempt and will not receive this error.

#### HTTP 503 Status: Message Variants & Handling

---

##### A. “Unknown error, please check your request or try again later.” (Execution status **unknown**)

- **Meaning**: Request accepted but no response before timeout; **execution may
  have succeeded**.
- **Handling**:
  - **Do not treat as immediate failure**; first verify via **WebSocket
    updates** or **orderId queries** to avoid duplicates.
  - During peaks, prefer **single orders** over batch to reduce uncertainty.
- **Rate-limit counting**: **May or may not** count, check header to verify rate
  limit info

---

##### B. “Service Unavailable.” (Failure)

- **Meaning**: Service temporarily unavailable; **100% failure**.
- **Handling**: **Retry with exponential backoff** (e.g., 200ms → 400ms → 800ms,
  max 3–5 attempts).
- **Rate-limit counting**: **not counted**

---

###### C. “Request throttled by system-level protection. Reduce-only/close-position orders are exempt. Please try again.” (**\-1008**, Failure)

- **Meaning**: System overload; **100% failure**.
- **Handling**: **Retry with backoff** and **reduce concurrency**;
- **Applicable endpoints**:
  - `POST /fapi/v1/order` / `POST /dapi/v1/order` / `POST /papi/v1/order`
  - `POST /fapi/v1/batchOrders` / `POST /dapi/v1/batchOrders` /
    `POST papi/v1/batchOrders`
- **Rate-limit counting**: **Not counted** (overload protection).
- **Exception integrated here**: When a request **reduces exposure**
  (Reduce-only / Close-position: `closePosition = true`, or
  `positionSide = BOTH` with `reduceOnly = true`, or `LONG+SELL`, or
  `SHORT+BUY`), it is **not affected or prioritized under -1008** to ensure risk
  reduction.
  - Covered endpoints:
    `POST /fapi/v1/order`、`POST /dapi/v1/order`、`POST /papi/v1/order`、`POST /fapi/v1/batchOrders`、`POST /dapi/v1/batchOrders`、`POST /papi/v1/batchOrders`
    (when parameters satisfy the condition)

#### Error Codes and Messages

- Any endpoint can return an ERROR
- Specific error codes and messages defined in Error Codes.

#### General Information on Endpoints

- For `GET` endpoints, parameters must be sent as a `query string`.
- For `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` endpoints, the parameters may be sent as a
  `query string` or in the `request body` with content type
  `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. You may mix parameters between both the
  `query string` and `request body` if you wish to do so.
- Parameters may be sent in any order.
- If a parameter sent in both the `query string` and `request body`, the
  `query string` parameter will be used.

### LIMITS

- A `429` will be returned when either rate limit is violated.

Binance has the right to further tighten the rate limits on users with intent to
attack.

#### IP Limits

- Every request will contain `X-MBX-USED-WEIGHT-(intervalNum)(intervalLetter)`
  in the response headers which has the current used weight for the IP for all
  request rate limiters defined.
- Each route has a `weight` which determines for the number of requests each
  endpoint counts for. Heavier endpoints and endpoints that do operations on
  multiple symbols will have a heavier `weight`.
- When a `429` is received, it's your obligation as an API to back off and not
  spam the API.
- **Repeatedly violating rate limits and/or failing to back off after receiving
  429s will result in an automated IP ban (HTTP status 418).**
- IP bans are tracked and **scale in duration** for repeat offenders, **from 2
  minutes to 3 days**.
- **The limits on the API are based on the IPs, not the API keys.**
- Portfolio Margin IP Limit is 6000/min.

It is strongly recommended to use websocket stream for getting data as much as
possible, which can not only ensure the timeliness of the message, but also
reduce the access restriction pressure caused by the request.

#### Order Rate Limits

- Every order response will contain a
  `X-MBX-ORDER-COUNT-(intervalNum)(intervalLetter)` header which has the current
  order count for the account for all order rate limiters defined.
- Rejected/unsuccessful orders are not guaranteed to have `X-MBX-ORDER-COUNT-**`
  headers in the response.
- **The order rate limit is counted against each account**.
- Portfolio Margin Order Limits are 1200/min.

### Endpoint Security Type

- Each endpoint has a security type that determines the how you will interact
  with it.
- API-keys are passed into the Rest API via the `X-MBX-APIKEY` header.
- API-keys and secret-keys are **case sensitive**.
- API-keys can be configured to only access certain types of secure endpoints.
  For example, one API-key could be used for TRADE only, while another API-key
  can access everything except for TRADE routes.
- By default, API-keys can access all secure routes.

| Security Type | Description                                              |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| NONE          | Endpoint can be accessed freely.                         |
| TRADE         | Endpoint requires sending a valid API-Key and signature. |
| USER_DATA     | Endpoint requires sending a valid API-Key and signature. |
| USER_STREAM   | Endpoint requires sending a valid API-Key and signature. |

### SIGNED (TRADE and USER_DATA) Endpoint Security

- `SIGNED` endpoints require an additional parameter, signature, to be sent in
  the `query string` or `request body`.
- Endpoints use `HMAC SHA256` signatures. The `HMAC SHA256` signature is a keyed
  `HMAC SHA256` operation. Use your `secretKey` as the key and `totalParams` as
  the value for the HMAC operation.
- The `signature` is not case sensitive.
- Please make sure the `signature` is the end part of your `query string` or
  `request body`.
- `totalParam`s is defined as the `query string` concatenated with the
  `request body`.

#### Timing security

- A `SIGNED` endpoint also requires a parameter, `timestamp`, to be sent which
  should be the millisecond timestamp of when the request was created and sent.
- An additional parameter, `recvWindow`, may be sent to specify the number of
  milliseconds after `timestamp` the request is valid for. If `recvWindow` is
  not sent, **it defaults to 5000**. `recvWindow` cannot exceed 60000.
- If the server determines that the timestamp sent by the client is more than
  one second in the future of the server time, the request will also be
  rejected.

**Serious trading is about timing.** Networks can be unstable and unreliable,
which can lead to requests taking varying amounts of time to reach the servers.
With `recvWindow`, you can specify that the request must be processed within a
certain number of milliseconds or be rejected by the server.

It is recommended to use a small recvWindow of 5000 or less! The max cannot go
beyond 60,000!

#### RSA Keys - SIGNED Endpoint Examples for POST /papi/v1/um/order

- This will be a step by step process how to create the signature payload to
  send a valid signed payload.
- We support `PKCS#8` currently.
- To get your API key, you need to upload your RSA Public Key to your account
  and a corresponding API key will be provided for you.

For this example, the private key will be referenced as `test-prv-key.pem`

| Key         | Value                                                            |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| apiKey      | vE3BDAL1gP1UaexugRLtteaAHg3UO8Nza20uexEuW1Kh3tVwQfFHdAiyjjY428o2 |
| Parameter   | Value                                                            |
| ---         | ---                                                              |
| symbol      | BTCUSDT                                                          |
| side        | BUY                                                              |
| type        | LIMIT                                                            |
| timeInForce | GTC                                                              |
| quantity    | 1                                                                |
| price       | 2000                                                             |
| recvWindow  | 5000                                                             |
| timestamp   | 1611825601400                                                    |

**Step 1: Construct the payload**

Arrange the list of parameters into a string. Separate each parameter with a
`&`.

**Step 2: Compute the signature:**

2.1 - Encode signature payload as ASCII data.

> **Step 2.2**

```
 $ echo -n 'timestamp=1671090801999&recvWindow=9999999&symbol=BTCUSDT&side=SELL&type=MARKET&quantity=1.23' | openssl dgst -keyform PEM -sha256 -sign ./test-prv-key.pem
```

2.2 - Sign payload using RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 algorithm with SHA-256 hash function.

> **Step 2.3**

```
$ echo -n 'timestamp=1671090801999&recvWindow=9999999&symbol=BTCUSDT&side=SELL&type=MARKET&quantity=1.23' | openssl dgst -keyform PEM -sha256 -sign ./test-prv-key.pem | openssl enc -base64
aap36wD5loVXizxvvPI3wz9Cjqwmb3KVbxoym0XeWG1jZq8umqrnSk8H8dkLQeySjgVY91Ufs%2BBGCW%2B4sZjQEpgAfjM76riNxjlD3coGGEsPsT2lG39R%2F1q72zpDs8pYcQ4A692NgHO1zXcgScTGgdkjp%2Brp2bcddKjyz5XBrBM%3D
```

2.3 - Encode output as base64 string.

> **Step 2.4**

```
$  echo -n 'timestamp=1671090801999&recvWindow=9999999&symbol=BTCUSDT&side=SELL&type=MARKET&quantity=1.23' | openssl dgst -keyform PEM -sha256 -sign ./test-prv-key.pem | openssl enc -base64 | tr -d '\n'
aap36wD5loVXizxvvPI3wz9Cjqwmb3KVbxoym0XeWG1jZq8umqrnSk8H8dkLQeySjgVY91Ufs%2BBGCW%2B4sZjQEpgAfjM76riNxjlD3coGGEsPsT2lG39R%2F1q72zpDs8pYcQ4A692NgHO1zXcgScTGgdkjp%2Brp2bcddKjyz5XBrBM%3D
```

2.4 - Delete any newlines in the signature.

> **Step 2.5**

```
aap36wD5loVXizxvvPI3wz9Cjqwmb3KVbxoym0XeWG1jZq8umqrnSk8H8dkLQeySjgVY91Ufs%2BBGCW%2B4sZjQEpgAfjM76riNxjlD3coGGEsPsT2lG39R%2F1q72zpDs8pYcQ4A692NgHO1zXcgScTGgdkjp%2Brp2bcddKjyz5XBrBM%3D
```

2.5 - Since the signature may contain `/` and `=`, this could cause issues with
sending the request. So the signature has to be URL encoded.

> **Step 2.6**

```
 curl -H "X-MBX-APIKEY: vE3BDAL1gP1UaexugRLtteaAHg3UO8Nza20uexEuW1Kh3tVwQfFHdAiyjjY428o2" -X POST 'https://papi.binance.com/papi/v1/um/order?timestamp=1671090801999&recvWindow=9999999&symbol=BTCUSDT&side=SELL&type=MARKET&quantity=1.23&signature=aap36wD5loVXizxvvPI3wz9Cjqwmb3KVbxoym0XeWG1jZq8umqrnSk8H8dkLQeySjgVY91Ufs%2BBGCW%2B4sZjQEpgAfjM76riNxjlD3coGGEsPsT2lG39R%2F1q72zpDs8pYcQ4A692NgHO1zXcgScTGgdkjp%2Brp2bcddKjyz5XBrBM%3D'
```

2.6 - curl command

> **Bash script**

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Set up authentication:
