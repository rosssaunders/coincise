## Generate an API Key

- Before being able to sign any requests, you must create an API Key at the API
  Management page on[BingX](https://bingx.com)Upon creating a key you will have
  2 pieces of information which you should remember:API key and Secret key.
- While setting the API key, it is recommended to set the IP access whitelist
  for security reasons
- Never tell anyone your API key/Secret key

If the API key is accidentally leaked, please delete it immediately and produce
a new API key
