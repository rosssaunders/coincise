original parameters:
batchOrders=\[{"symbol":"ETH-USDT","type":"MARKET","side":"BUY","positionSide":"LONG","quantity":1},{"symbol":"BTC-USDT","type":"MARKET","side":"BUY","positionSide":"LONG","quantity":0.001}\]×tamp=1692956597902

- 3\. url encode each value,for example the value of batchOrders field,except
  timestamp field value (not url encode the key, not url encode entire original
  parametersg), make it like below:

after url encoded:
batchOrders=%5B%7B%22symbol%22%3A%22ETH-USDT%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22MARKET%22%2C%22side%22%3A%22BUY%22%2C%22positionSide%22%3A%22LONG%22%2C%22quantity%22%3A1%7D%2C%7B%22symbol%22%3A%22BTC-USDT%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22MARKET%22%2C%22side%22%3A%22BUY%22%2C%22positionSide%22%3A%22LONG%22%2C%22quantity%22%3A0.001%7D%5D×tamp=1692956597902

- 4\. final request should be like

Batch orders are processed concurrently, and order matching order is not
guaranteed

The minimum order quantity can be obtained from the api
/openApi/swap/v2/quote/contracts: tradeMinQuantity, tradeMinUSDT

Trading Rules:

- Trading Rules:
  [https://bingx.com/en/tradeInfo/perpetual/trading-rules/BTC-USDT/](https://bingx.com/en/tradeInfo/perpetual/trading-rules/BTC-USDT/)
- About price accuracy and quantity accuracy reference interface:
  [https://open-api.bingx.com/openApi/swap/v2/quote/contracts](https://open-api.bingx.com/openApi/swap/v2/quote/contracts)
- If the accuracy exceeds the range of the current period, the current API order
  will still be successful, but it will be truncated. For example, the price
  requirement is: 0.0001, if the order is 0.123456, it will be successfully
  submitted with 0.1234.
