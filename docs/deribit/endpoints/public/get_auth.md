## /public/auth

Retrieve an Oauth access token, to be used for authentication of 'private'
requests.

Three methods of authentication are supported:

- `client_credentials` - using the client id and client secret that can be found
  on the API page on the website
- `client_signature` - using the client id that can be found on the API page on
  the website and user generated signature. The signature is calculated using
  some fields provided in the request, using formula described here
  [Deribit signature credentials](#additional-authorization-method-signature-credentials-websocket-api)
- `refresh_token` - using a refresh token that was received from an earlier
  invocation

The response will contain an access token, expiration period (number of seconds
that the token is valid) and a refresh token that can be used to get a new set
of tokens.

| grant_type | true     | string | `client_credentials` |

`client_signature`  
`refresh_token` | Method of authentication | | client_id | true | string | |
Required for grant type `client_credentials` and `client_signature` | |
client_secret | true | string | | Required for grant type `client_credentials` |
| refresh_token | true | string | | Required for grant type `refresh_token` | |
timestamp | true | integer | | Required for grant type `client_signature`,
provides time when request has been generated (milliseconds since the UNIX
epoch) | | signature | true | string | | Required for grant type
`client_signature`; it's a cryptographic signature calculated over provided
fields using user **secret key**. The signature should be calculated as an HMAC
(Hash-based Message Authentication Code) with `SHA256` hash algorithm | | nonce
| false | string | | Optional for grant type `client_signature`; delivers user
generated initialization vector for the server token | | data | false | string |
| Optional for grant type `client_signature`; contains any user specific value |
| state | false | string | | Will be passed back in the response | | scope |
false | string | | Describes type of the access for assigned token, possible
values: `connection`, `session:name`, `trade:[read, read_write, none]`,
`wallet:[read, read_write, none]`, `account:[read, read_write, none]`,
`expires:NUMBER`, `ip:ADDR`.
