# GET /private/verify\_block\_trade

Verifies and creates block trade signature  
  
**Note:** In the API, the `direction` field is always expressed from the maker's perspective. This means that when you accept a block trade as a taker, the direction shown in the API represents the opposite side of your trade. For example, if you are buying puts as a taker, the API will show the operation as a "sell put" (maker's perspective), and you will be verifying and accepting a "sell put" block trade.
