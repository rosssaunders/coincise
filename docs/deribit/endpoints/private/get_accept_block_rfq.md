## /private/accept_block_rfq

**Taker method**

This method allows Block RFQ taker to accept the response by sending a single
crossing price. The order can be either filled immediately (`fill_or_kill`) or
remain active until cancelled (`good_til_cancelled`). Please note that after
Block RFQ creation, a grace period of 5 seconds begins, during which the taker
cannot see quotes or trade the Block RFQ.

**Scope:** `block_rfq:read_write`

This is a private method; it can only be used after authentication.
