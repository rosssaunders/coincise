# GET /private/execute\_block\_trade

Creates block trade  
  
The whole request have to be exact the same as in `private/verify_block_trade`, only `role` field should be set appropriately - it basically means that both sides have to agree on the same `timestamp`, `nonce`, `trades` fields and server will assure that `role` field is different between sides (each party accepted own role).  
  
Using the same `timestamp` and `nonce` by both sides in `private/verify_block_trade` assures that even if unintentionally both sides execute given block trade with valid `counterparty_signature`, the given block trade will be executed only once.  
  
**Note:** In the API, the `direction` field is always expressed from the maker's perspective. This means that when you accept a block trade as a taker, the direction shown in the API represents the opposite side of your trade. For example, if you are buying puts as a taker, the API will show the operation as a "sell put" (maker's perspective), and you will be verifying and accepting a "sell put" block trade.
