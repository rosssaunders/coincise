# GET /private/get_block_rfqs

This method returns a list of Block RFQs that were either created by the user or
assigned to them as a maker, sorted in descending order. `trades` and
`mark_price` are only visible for the filled Block RFQ. When a `block_rfq_id` is
specified, only that particular Block RFQ will be returned. If called by a
`taker`, response will additionally include `makers` list and `label` if
previously provided. If called by the `maker`, the `trades` will include the
maker's alias, but only for trades in which this maker participated. Can be
optionally filtered by currency.

**Scope:** `block_rfq:read`

This is a private method; it can only be used after authentication.
