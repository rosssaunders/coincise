## Description

See Python SDK for full featured examples on the fields of the order request.

For limit orders, TIF (time-in-force) sets the behavior of the order upon first hitting the book.

ALO (add liquidity only, i.e. "post only") will be canceled instead of immediately matching.

IOC (immediate or cancel) will have the unfilled part canceled instead of resting.

GTC (good til canceled) orders have no special behavior.

Client Order ID (cloid) is an optional 128 bit hex string, e.g. `0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef`
