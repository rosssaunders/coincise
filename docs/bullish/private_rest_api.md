# Overview

Welcome to the _Bullish Trading API_ documentation!

This documentation provides resource descriptions and endpoints usage
instructions for the API.

The API:

- follows [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)
  conventions
- has the base URL `api.exchange.bullish.com` (unless one of the sandbox
  environments is being used)
- has endpoints under the below categories:
  - Authenticated endpoints for private client data e.g.
    [Get Orders](#get-/v2/orders) endpoint
  - Non-authenticated endpoints for public data e.g.
    [Get Markets](#get-/v1/markets) endpoint
- uses bearer-based authentication
- enforces a blanket rate limit across all requests
- may add new fields to existing response payloads. Please do not use strict
  deserialisation as it may cause compatibility issues.

# Connectivity Options

In GCP, generally our most optimal connection is to operate within
asia-southeast1-a Availability Zone. Please note, this may change at any given
moment and without warning to another Availability Zone within asia-southeast1
for operational reasons. For AWS or GCP connectivity details, please contact
your sales representative

# FIX API

The FIX API is available to institutional clients and is only accessible through
a AWS or GCP private connection:

- AWS PrivateLink
  - It provides private connectivity between VPCs, AWS service without exposing
    your traffic to the public internet. Bullish will provide the published
    service IDs for this service. You will be able to connect to our FIX service
    endpoint once the connection has been successfully established.
- GCP Private Service Connect
  - It allows customers to access managed services privately from inside their
    VPC network. Bullish will provide the published service IDs for this
    service. You will be able to connect to our FIX service endpoint once the
    connection has been successfully established.

For more details please refer to the full specification:

- [Bullish FIX Protocol Specification](../../fix-api/Bullish%20FIX%20Protocol%20Specification%20v1.0.12.pdf)
- [Bullish FIX Protocol Dictionary](../../fix-api/fix-dictionary.xml)
- [Bullish FIX CRT Certificate](../../fix-api/bullish.crt)

# Exchange Time

All timestamps are specified in
[EPOCH time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time).

# Pagination Support

If specified in the API documentation, an endpoint may return cursor paginated
responses. Default page size is 25.

There are 4 special query parameters used to control the pagination behaviour.

- `_pageSize` can be one of `5, 25, 50, 100`, default value is `25`
- `_metaData` can be false/true, if false the links are NOT part of the
  response. explicitly set `_metaData=true` to guarantee links are returned.
- `_nextPage` cursor to the next page. It is provided in the paginated response
  when `_metaData=true`.
- `_previousPage` cursor to the previous page. It is provided in the paginated
  response when `_metaData=true`.

The paginated data is returned in the following wrapped format with generated
links to the previous and next pages:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "averageFillPrice": null,
      "baseFee": "0.00000000",
      "createdAtDatetime": "2018-11-18T00:00:00.000Z",
      "createdAtTimestamp": "1639464207402",
      "handle": null,
      "margin": false,
      "orderId": "390755652232282113",
      "price": "8520.7000",
      "quantity": "1.00000000",
      "quantityFilled": "0.00000000",
      "quoteAmount": "0.0000",
      "quoteFee": "0.0003",
      "side": "BUY",
      "status": "OPEN",
      "statusReason": "Open",
      "statusReasonCode": "6001",
      "stopPrice": null,
      "symbol": "BTCUSD",
      "timeInForce": "GTC",
      "type": "LMT"
    },
    ...
  ],
  "links": {
    "next": "/trading-api/v1/orders?_pageSize=5&symbol=BTCUSD&_nextPage=Mjk3NzM1MzQ5NDI0NjIwMDMy",
    "previous": "/trading-api/v1/orders?_pageSize=5&symbol=BTCUSD&_previousPage=Mjk3NzM1Mzg3NzQ3OTc1Njgw"
  }
}
```

# Filtering Support

- If specified in the API documentation, an endpoint may support filters on
  specific fields and values e.g. `GET /orders?status=OPEN`
- Only fields returned in an API response may be used as filter parameters. What
  you see is what you query on and by.
- For the fields in the API response usable as filter parameters, please consult
  the API endpoint of interest.
- Datetime and timestamp filters require additional keywords from this list -
  `[ gte, lte, gt, lt ]`. A few examples are provided below.
  - `/trading-api/v1/trades?createdAtTimestamp[gte]=1686447835000` queries for
    trades with `createdAtTimestamp` greater than or equal to `1686447835000`.
  - `/trading-api/v1/trades?createdAtDatetime[gte]=2023-04-06T00:00:00.000Z&createdAtDatetime[lte]=2023-06-07T00:00:00.000Z`
    queries for trades with `createdAtDatetime` greater than or equal to
    `2023-04-06T00:00:00.000Z` but less than or equal to
    `2023-06-07T00:00:00.000Z`
- By design, pagination query parameters start with an underscore. This
  differentiates them from filter query parameters e.g.
  `GET /orders?status=OPEN&_pageSize=25`

# Rate Limits

## Public Endpoints

The below mentioned public endpoints will be rate limited. For more information
please reach out to your Bullish customer support.

- [/trading-api/v1/markets](#get-/v1/markets) and subpaths
- [/trading-api/v1/market-data](#overview--multi-orderbook-websocket-unauthenticated)
  and subpaths
- [/trading-api/v1/history/markets](#get-/v1/history/markets/-symbol-/trades)
  and subpaths
- [/trading-api/v1/assets](#get-/v1/assets) and subpaths
- [/trading-api/v1/index-prices](#get-/v1/index-prices) and subpaths
- [/trading-api/v1/index-data](#overview--index-data-websocket-unauthenticated)
  and subpaths

## Private Endpoints

API endpoints denoted by `Ratelimited: True` in the description are also subject
to rate limits. e.g. [Create Order](#post-/v2/orders). The API endpoints fall
under the below categories. The rate limit for each category is _independently_
applied.

- Unauthenticated endpoints, rate limited at 50 requests per second.
- Authenticated `/orders` endpoints, rate limited at 50 requests per second.
- Other Authenticated endpoints, rate limited at 50 requests per second.

### Rate Limits per IP address

Each IP address is subject to a blanket rate limit of 500 requests per 10
seconds (approximately 50 requests per second). If an IP address is rate
limited, the http response status code will be `429 Too Many Requests` and the
IP address is blocked from making any requests for 60 seconds.

### Global Rate Limit

The global rate limit is an additional rate limit specific to the exchange. It
is used to help limit the flow of orders into the exchange. It affects all
clients fairly. When the global rate limit is breached the
`x-ratelimit-global-breach` header value will be set to `true` else `false`.

### Rate Limits Info

When rate limits are not exceeded, the http response header of the API endpoint
called will contain the below:

- `x-ratelimit-limit`: Maximum number of requests allowed for the specific API
  category within time period.
- `x-ratelimit-remaining`: Remaining number of requests allowed for the specific
  API category within time period.
- `x-ratelimit-reset`: The next time period in which `x-ratelimit-remaining` is
  reset back to the maximum allowed for the specific API category.
- `x-ratelimit-global-breach`: true/false, indicating whether the global limit
  has been breached.

### Exceeding Rate Limits

When rate limits are exceeded, the API endpoint will return the http response
status code `429 Too Many Requests` and the http response body will be:

```json
{
  "errorCode": 96000,
  "errorCodeName": "RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED",
  "message": "Rate limit exceeded"
}
```

### Exceeding The Global Rate Limit

When the global rate limit is exceeded, the API endpoint will return the http
response status code `429 Too Many Requests` and the http response body will be:

```json
{
  "errorCode": 96001,
  "errorCodeName": "GLOBAL_RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED",
  "message": "Global rate limit exceeded"
}
```

### Increasing Rate Limits

For more information on increasing your rate limits, please reach out to your
sales representative.

### Obtaining Your Rate Limit Token

Each trading account has a unique rate limit token that can be obtained by
querying [Get Trading Accounts](#get-/v1/accounts/trading-accounts). The rate
limit token must be provided in the HTTP request header `BX-RATELIMIT-TOKEN` to
enjoy higher tiers of rate limits else the default of 50 msgs/sec is applied.

# Price And Quantity Precision

A market consists of two assets, namely base asset and quote asset. For
instance, the `BTCUSD` market has `BTC` as base asset and `USD` as quote asset.
The price of a market is denominated in the quote asset, while the quantity is
denominated in the base asset. For instance, the price in `BTCUSD` market is in
`USD` while the quantity is in `BTC`. Each asset has its own precision. For
this, the below asset APIs can be queried.

- The [Get Assets](#get-/v1/assets) API endpoint for all supported asset symbols
- The [Get Asset By Symbol](#get-/v1/assets/-symbol-) API endpoint for a
  specific asset symbol

The precision of an asset is the number of decimal places used to express its
value in. For instance, the quantity in the market `BTCUSD` is in BTC. As BTC
has a precision of 8, the quantity in `BTCUSD` has 8 decimal places. It follows
that in order to express a quantity of 1 BTC in `BTCUSD` market, it has to be
`1.00000000` BTC.

Alternatively, the below market APIs can also be queried to obtain the price and
quantity precisions for different markets.

- The [Get Markets](#get-/v1/markets) API endpoint for all supported market
  symbols
- The [Get Market By Symbol](#get-/v1/markets/-symbol-) API endpoint for a
  specific market symbol

Following the logic outlined above,

- The precision for quantity is defined by the `basePrecision`
- The precision for price is defined by `quotePrecision`

# Numeric Identifier Contraints

Numeric (i64) identifiers such as `nonce` and `handle` should not have leading
zero's. For example `009990822212000000` is invalid but `9990822212000000` is
valid.

# Order timeInForce

The order `timeInForce` can be set to the following values:

- `GTC` - good until cancelled - the order is open forever unless fully filled
  or cancelled
- `FOK` - fill or kill - if the order cannot immediately be filled in full it is
  cancelled
- `IOC` - immediate or cancel - the order is immediately filled in full or in
  part and any remainder is cancelled

# Error & Rejection Codes

Details of `statusReasonCode` and `statusReason` can be referenced from
[Error & Rejection Codes](https://github.com/bullish-exchange/api-docs/wiki/Error-&-Rejection-Codes)

# Authentication

The API uses bearer based authentication. A JWT token is valid for 24 hours
only. To generate a JWT token see -
[Generate A JWT Token](#overview--generate-a-jwt-token)

# How To Send Authenticated Requests

To send an authenticated request, you must follow these steps:

1. [Generate An API Key](#overview--generate-an-api-key)
2. [Add Authenticated Request Header](#overview--add-authenticated-request-header)
3. [Generate A JWT Token](#overview--generate-a-jwt-token)
4. [Construct The BX-NONCE Header](#overview--construct-the-bx-nonce-header)
5. [Construct The Command You Want To Send](#overview--construct-the-command-you-want-to-send)

10. [How do EMS/Brokers Flag Their Executions Sent To Bullish](#overview--how-do-emsbrokers-flag-their-executions-sent-to-bullish)

## Generate An API Key

A prerequisite to generate API keys is to have a Bullish account. To generate an
API key follow these steps:

1. Log in into your Bullish account
2. Click on your account initials at the upper right corner and then click
   **Settings**
3. Click **API Keys** and then click **Add API Key**
4. Select the API Key type, either ECDSA or HMAC
5. Enter a key name in the _Key Name_ field
6. Adding an IP whitelist is optional. Should an IP whitelist be added, login
   requests must be from within the IP whitelist range.
7. Click _Generate API Key_

### HMAC API Key Notes

- A HMAC API Key is a shared secret key that is used for HMAC based signing of
  trading API requests
- Always store your HMAC secret in a secure medium as they are used to sign your
  requests. Do not share your HMAC secret in any publicly accessible areas such
  as code repositories, client side code, or other vulnerable areas and make
  sure the keys are not shipped with your mobile or web apps.
- You do not need the `metadata` string to extract your `userId` like you would
  a Bullish API Key
- HMAC API Keys can only be used for Trading on Bullish; the JWT generated using
  an HMAC API Key is only valid for trading endpoints.

### ECDSA API Key Notes

- An ECDSA API key is a public/private key pair used for ECDSA based signing of
  trading and custody API requests
- The private key is what you will use to sign your requests. Always store your
  private keys in a secure medium as they are used to sign your requests. Do not
  share your private keys in any publicly accessible areas such as code
  repositories, client side code, or other vulnerable areas and make sure the
  keys are not shipped with your mobile or web apps.
- From here on the:
  - public key will be referred to as `PUBLIC_KEY`
  - private key will be referred to as `PRIVATE_KEY`
- Key and signature format details:
  - Curve: ECDSA R1 (prime256v1/secp256r1/P-256)
  - Signature encoding: DER
  - Hashing Algorithm: SHA256
  - Key format: X.509 SubjectPublicKeyInfo format, PEM encoded

An ECDSA API key additionally has a `metadata` string associated with it which
is displayed along side the key. You must base64 decode the `metadata` to
extract your `userId` (example follows). You will need the `userId` in the next
step.

```shell
echo eyJwdWJsaWNLZXkiOiJQVUJfUjFfNWNpVW52TW5rVThMOVBCWnZaa1BGcjhqdkRnUHpzcHhWNGlqOThIN1JqM1FSNzJyMkEiLCJhY2NvdW50SWQiOjIyMjAwMDAwMDAwMDAwNCwiY3JlZGVudGlhbElkIjoiMTAifQ== | base64 --decode
{"publicKey":"PUB_R1_5ciUnvMnkU8L9PBZvZkPFr8jvDgPzspxV4ij98H7Rj3QR72r2A","userId":"12345","accountId":"12345","credentialId":"10"}
```

## Add Authenticated Request Header

Each authenticated request must include a `Authorization` header:

- `Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>`

The JWT is valid for 24 hours.

## Generate a JWT Token

### Bullish API Key

#### **`Deprecated`** [[more info](.././deprecated/index.html#overview--bullish-key)]: _Existing Bullish API key will no longer be usable as of `28 June, 2024`_

To generate/get a JWT token for a Bullish API Key you will need to perform the
following request:

#### POST /trading-api/v2/users/login

- Body
  - `publicKey` - bullish account public key
  - `userId` - bullish user id corresponding to the metadata
  - `signature` - signed JSON string encoding of `loginPayload`, see the code
    sample for how to get it
  - `expirationTime` - epoch timestamp in seconds that is 5 minutes in the
    future
  - `nonce` - epoch timestamp in seconds; note this login API nonce has no
    connection to the orders API nonce
  - `biometricsUsed` - set to `false`
  - `sessionKey` - set to `null`

```json
{
  "publicKey": "<PUBLIC_KEY>",
  "signature": "<SIGNATURE>",
  "loginPayload": {
    "userId": "100008771"
    "nonce": 1638776636,
    "expirationTime": 1638776936,
    "biometricsUsed": false,
    "sessionKey": null
  }
}
```

- Response

```json
{
  "authorizer": "<AUTHORIZER>",
  "token": "<JWT_TOKEN>"
}
```

See
[generate JWT](https://github.com/bullish-exchange/api-examples/blob/master/session)
for sample Python scripts.

### HMAC API Key

To generate/get a JWT token for a HMAC API Key you will need to perform the
following request:

#### GET /trading-api/v1/users/hmac/login

- Response

```json
{
  "authorizer": "<AUTHORIZER>",
  "token": "<JWT_TOKEN>"
}
```

You will need to provide a series of headers along with the request in order to
successfully generate a JWT token.

- `BX-TIMESTAMP` - number of milliseconds since EPOCH
- `BX-NONCE` - client side incremented 64-bit unsigned integer
- `BX-PUBLIC-KEY` - Public key for the HMAC Key being used to generate the JWT
- `BX-SIGNATURE` - The signed message related to the login request. Outlined
  below

To sign the login request for an HMAC API Key login we will need to construct a
string that concatenates the following fields:

- timestamp - value provided for the `BX-TIMESTAMP` header
- nonce - value provided for the `BX-NONCE`
- request method - `GET`
- request path - `/trading-api/v1/users/hmac/login`

See
[generate JWT](https://github.com/bullish-exchange/api-examples/blob/master/session/generate_jwt_hmac.py)
for a sample Python script.

### ECDSA API Key

To generate/get a JWT token for a ECDSA API Key you will need to perform the
following request:

#### POST /trading-api/v2/users/login

- Body
  - `publicKey` - ECDSA public key; new line characters should be UNIX encoded
    (\n, not \r\n or \r)
  - `userId` - bullish user id corresponding to the metadata
  - `signature` - signed JSON string encoding of `loginPayload`, see the code
    sample for how to get it
  - `expirationTime` - epoch timestamp in seconds that is 5 minutes in the
    future
  - `nonce` - epoch timestamp in seconds; note this login API nonce has no
    connection to the orders API nonce
  - `biometricsUsed` - set to `false`
  - `sessionKey` - set to `null`

```json
{
  "publicKey": "<PUBLIC_KEY>",
  "signature": "<SIGNATURE>",
  "loginPayload": {
    "userId": "100008771"
    "nonce": 1638776636,
    "expirationTime": 1638776936,
    "biometricsUsed": false,
    "sessionKey": null
  }
}
```

- Response

```json
{
  "authorizer": "<AUTHORIZER>",
  "token": "<JWT_TOKEN>"
}
```

See
[generate JWT](https://github.com/bullish-exchange/api-examples/blob/master/session/generate_jwt_ecdsa.py)
for a sample Python script.

## Logout using a JWT Token

Users can better manage their sessions by logging out of unused sessions. This
can be done by calling the `GET /trading-api/v1/users/logout` endpoint with the
JWT Token in the header - see
[Add Authenticated Request Header](#overview--add-authenticated-request-header).

## Construct The BX-NONCE Header

The header `BX-NONCE` value is a unique client-side 64-bit unsigned integer. It
has the following characteristics:

- Each request the client sends how have incrementing `BX-NONCE` value
- To prevent a client to send the max value of a 64-bit unsigned integer and
  thus immediately exhaust all unique nonces the exchange will only accept a
  nonce within a specified range
- The lower and upper bounds of the current nonce range are specified by nonce
  endpoint e.g. `GET /nonce`
- The nonce range is updated daily
- The nonce `lowerBound` is the start of day EPOCH timestamp in micro seconds
- The nonce `upperBound` is the end of day EPOCH timestamp in micro seconds

## Construct The Command You Want To Send

Each authenticated request contains a `<COMMAND>` to be executed by the API. A
`<COMMAND>` has the following properties:

- A `<COMMAND>` is JSON encoded
- Every field in the JSON payload must have a value. Use `null` to represent the
  absence of a value
- The fields must be specified and encoded in the order presented in this
  documentation

Find below two `<COMMAND>` examples:

1. [Create Spot Order](#overview--create-spot-order-example)
2. [Create Margin Order](#overview--create-margin-order-example)
3. [Cancel Order](#overview--cancel-order-example)

### Create Spot Order Example

To create a Spot buy limit order:

- for the BTCUSD market
- at a price of `55071.5000`
- for a quantity of `1.87000000`
- with a time-in-force of `GTC` (good till cancelled)

The COMMAND would be constructed like below:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "<TIMESTAMP>",
  "nonce": "<NONCE>",
  "authorizer": "<AUTHORIZER>",
  "command": {
    "commandType": "V2CreateOrder",
    "handle": null,
    "symbol": "BTCUSD",
    "type": "LMT",
    "side": "BUY",
    "price": "55071.5000",
    "stopPrice": null,
    "quantity": "1.87000000",
    "timeInForce": "GTC",
    "allowMargin": false,
    "tradingAccountId": "111234567890"
  }
}
```

### Create Margin Order Example

With reference to the same payload in
[Create Spot Order](#overview--create-spot-order-example), setting the field
`allowMargin` to `true` will make it a margin order.

Documentation is available
[here](https://github.com/bullish-exchange/api-docs/blob/master/src/trading-api/next/websocket-private-data-update-messages-for-borrowers.pdf)
on what happens in the event of liquidation.

### Cancel Order Example

To cancel a buy limit order:

- for the BTCUSD market
- where the `orderId` is `390755251743358977`

The COMMAND would be constructed like below:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "<TIMESTAMP>",
  "nonce": "<NONCE>",
  "authorizer": "<AUTHORIZER>"
  "command": {
    "commandType": "V2CancelOrder",
    "orderId": "390755251743358977",
    "handle": null,
    "symbol": "BTCUSD",
    "tradingAccountId": "111234567890"
  }
}
```

### Add Amm instruction

```json
{
  "timestamp": "1621490985000",
  "nonce": "123456789",
  "authorizer": "03E02367E8C900000500000000000000",
  "command": {
    "commandType": "V2AddLiquidity",
    "symbol": "BTCUSD",
    "baseQuantity": "0.00000000",
    "quoteQuantity": "0.00000000",
    "upperBound": "14000.0000",
    "lowerBound": "12000.0000",
    "feeTierId": "1",
    "tradingAccountId": "111234567890"
  }
}
```

### Remove Amm instruction

```json
{
  "timestamp": "<TIMESTAMP>",
  "nonce": "<NONCE>",
  "authorizer": "<AUTHORIZER>"
  "command": {
    "commandType": "V2RemoveLiquidity",
    "liquidityId": "557839859386417160",
    "symbol": "BTCUSD",
    "tradingAccountId": "111234567890"
  }
}
```

### Command for Transfer Asset

`POST /trading-api/v1/command?commandType=V1TransferAsset`

```json
{
  "timestamp": "<TIMESTAMP>",
  "nonce": "<NONCE>",
  "authorizer": "<AUTHORIZER>"
  "command": {
    "commandType": "V1TransferAsset",
    "assetSymbol": "USD",
    "quantity": "7.0000",
    "fromTradingAccountId": "11123456789",
    "toTradingAccountId": "11198765432"
  }
}
```

## Construct The BX-SIGNATURE Header

The following signing formats demonstrates how to obtain the `BX-SIGNATURE`
header.

## Signing Format

This signing format works with `/trading-api/v2/orders`,
`/trading-api/v2/amm-instructions`, `/trading-api/v2/command` and
[Custody](#tag--custody) APIs. This signing format has the following benefits:

- Null fields need not be included in the HTTP request body
- Fields need not be strictly ordered in the HTTP request body

Construct a string that concatenates the following fields:

- timestamp - value provided for the `BX-TIMESTAMP` header
- nonce - value provided for the `BX-NONCE`
- request method - e.g. `POST`
- request path - e.g. `/trading-api/v2/orders`
- request JSON string, removing any spaces and newline characters.

Note that the same request JSON string used in signing must be sent as the HTTP
request body.

#### How To Sign - ECDSA API Key

1. Hash the above string using a SHA-256 hash function and sign the resulting
   hexdigest with your ECDSA `<PRIVATE_KEY>`.
2. DER encode the signature, and base64 encode the DER encoded signature.

See
[sign a request with ECDSA](https://github.com/bullish-exchange/api-examples/blob/master/orders/create_order_ecdsa.py)
for a sample Python script.

#### How To Sign - HMAC API Key

1. Hash the above string using a SHA-256 hash function and take the hexdigest.
2. Sign the hexdigest from step 2 with your HMAC Secret Key.

See
[sign a request with HMAC](https://github.com/bullish-exchange/api-examples/blob/master/orders/create_order_hmac.py)
for a sample Python script.

## Fetch Trading Account Ids

Trading Account Ids may be required by some endpoints. They can be fetched from
[Get All Trading Accounts](#get-/v1/accounts/trading-accounts).

See an API example
[Here](https://github.com/bullish-exchange/api-examples/blob/master/session/get_trading_accounts.py).

## Send The HTTP Authenticated Request

See
[create an order](https://github.com/bullish-exchange/api-examples/blob/master/orders/create_order_hmac.py)
for a sample Python script.

## How To Ensure The Order Of _Create Order_ or _Cancel Order_ Requests

To ensure the order of the _create order_ or _cancel order_ requests, you must
wait for an acknowledgement response which will contain the `orderId` generated
on the server side. Also remember that the `nonce` parameter, for these two
requests, must be a unique increasing integer value.

For example, let us assume the following:

- You sent 10 _create order_ requests in a row without waiting for an `orderId`
- The `nonce` increases with each request sent and thus
- The `nonce` is unique for each request

Because the requests received by the Bullish exchange are processed in parallel
the following two possible scenarios can happen:

- _happy scenario_ which has a small chance to occur: all 10 requests are
  processed in the exact order sent by the client, no error, all great and you
  are happy
- _unhappy scenario_ which has a higher chance to occur: the requests are not
  processed in the exact order sent by you, because the requests might arrive at
  the bullish processing server at different times and thus the validations of
  the `nonce` for each request take place at random times. Because of that all
  the requests that are validated and have the `nonce` higher than the latest
  valid `nonce` will be accepted as valid and the ones which have the `nonce`
  smaller than the last valid `nonce` will be considered invalid and dropped. In
  the worse case scenario the request with the highest `nonce`, the 10th request
  you sent, is validated first, and the rest of the 9 requests will fail the
  validation because they have the `nonce` smaller than the 10th. Also if some
  requests are failing because of some other errors, e.g. incorrect inputs or
  internal error, you will not know because you did not wait for the
  acknowledgement from the server side for each request you sent.

If you wait the acknowledgement from the server side you ensure the order of the
requests you sent and you can also verify the status of the order(s) you created
or cancelled.

## How To Enable Out-Of-Order Processing of Order Requests

The header `BX-NONCE-WINDOW-ENABLED` is a string representation of a boolean
value which enables out-of-order processing of _Create Order_ or _Cancel Order_
requests up to a window size of 100 from the highest previously used `nonce`
value (inclusive).

The `nonce` parameter is required to be both unique and incremental, but setting
`BX-NONCE-WINDOW-ENABLED` to `true` loosens this requirement such that the
`nonce` is only required to be `unique`. For example, the client is able to send
`nonce` values from `1...100` in any order and all the values will be valid.

# WebSockets

Connection request to the web-socket uses
[JWT_COOKIE based authentication](https://github.com/bullish-exchange/api-examples/blob/master/websocket/private_data_web_socket.py).
To generate a JWT token see -
[Generate A JWT Token](#overview--generate-a-jwt-token). Each web-socket exposes
a set of topics that can be subscribed to.

## Servers

- `wss://api.exchange.bullish.com` - PRODUCTION
- `wss://registered.api.exchange.bullish.com` - PRODUCTION
- `wss://prod.access.bullish.com` - PRODUCTION (Direct Connect)
- `wss://api.simnext.bullish-test.com` - SANDBOX
- `wss://registered.api.simnext.bullish-test.com` - SANDBOX
- `wss://simnext.access.bullish.com` - SANDBOX (Direct Connect)

## Max Open WebSocket Connections

Each WebSocket category has a maximum number of open connections. Once it is
reached, new WebSocket requests will be rejected. The WebSocket connections fall
under the below categories.

- Unauthenticated WebSockets, maximum of 100 open connections per IP address.
- Authenticated WebSockets, maximum of 10 open connections per API key.

## Send A Message Over The WebSocket

Messages sent by the client to the server over a web-socket follows the
[JSON-RPC 2.0 Specification](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification). The server
then returns a response following the same JSON-RPC 2.0 format. The `id` field
sent by the client will be included in the response, allowing the client to map
the server's responses to the messages sent by the client. The client ensures
the uniqueness of the `id` field.

Find below the message types accepted by the web-socket:

1. [Subscription Message](#overview--subscribe-to-a-topic)
2. [Keepalive Ping Message](#overview--keep-websocket-open)

## Subscribe To A Topic

Subscribe to receive a snapshot of your existing data and subsequently receive
updates.

Two types of subscription:

1. Subscribe by `<TOPIC>`
2. Subscribe by `<TOPIC>` and `<SYMBOL>` plus optional fields (if any)

Message fields:

- `<TOPIC>`: subscription topic
- `<SYMBOL>`: market symbol
- `<COMMAND_ID>`: unique unsigned long value

The subscription message would be constructed like below:

Subscribe by `<TOPIC>`

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "type": "command",
  "method": "subscribe",
  "params": {
    "topic": "<TOPIC>"
  },
  "id": "<COMMAND_ID>"
}
```

Subscribe by `<TOPIC>` and `<SYMBOL>`

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "type": "command",
  "method": "subscribe",
  "params": {
    "topic": "<TOPIC>",
    "symbol": "<SYMBOL>"
  },
  "id": "<COMMAND_ID>"
}
```

Sample subscription messages:

- Orders

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "type": "command",
  "method": "subscribe",
  "params": {
    "topic": "orders"
  },
  "id": "1611082473000"
}
```

- L1 Order Book

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "type": "command",
  "method": "subscribe",
  "params": {
      "topic": "l1Orderbook"
      "symbol": "BTCUSD"
  },
  "id": "1611082473000"
}
```

Find below the available `<TOPIC>`:

1. [Multi-OrderBook Data WebSocket](#overview--multi-orderbook-websocket-unauthenticated)
2. [Anonymous Trades WebSocket](#overview--anonymous-trades-websocket-unauthenticated)
3. [Anonymous Market Data WebSocket](#overview--anonymous-market-data-price-tick-unauthenticated)
4. [Index Data WebSocket](#overview--index-data-websocket-unauthenticated)
5. [Private Data WebSocket](#overview--private-data-websocket-authenticated)

## Keep WebSocket Open

Keep the web-socket connection open by sending keepalive ping messages
periodically. The web-socket closes automatically after 5 minutes.

The keepalive ping message would be constructed like below:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "type": "command",
  "method": "keepalivePing",
  "params": {},
  "id": "<COMMAND_ID>"
}
```

## Receive A Message From The WebSocket

JSON-RPC responses are of the following format:

Success responses

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "1650865877698",
  "result": {
    "responseCode": "200",
    "responseCodeName": "OK",
    "message": "Successfully subscribed"
  }
}
```

Error responses

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "1650865877698",
  "error": {
    "code": "-32602",
    "errorCode": "29013",
    "errorCodeName": "INVALID_TOPIC_ERROR",
    "message": "'a-random-topic' is not a valid topic"
}
```

- `code`: [JSON-RPC 2.0 error code](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification)
- `responseCode`/`errorCode`: unique ID for response/error code
- `responseCodeName`/`errorCodeName`: unique name for response/error code
- `message`: textual description of the `responseCode`/`errorCode`

Snapshot responses are of the following format:

```json
{
  "type": "snapshot",
  "dataType": "<DATA_TYPE>",
  "data": [ { <TOPIC_RESPONSE> } ]
}
```

Update responses are of the following format:

```json
{
  "type": "update",
  "dataType": "<DATA_TYPE>",
  "data": { <TOPIC_RESPONSE> }
}
```

Error responses are of the following format:

```json
{
  "type": "error",
  "dataType": "V1TAErrorResponse",
  "data": {
    "errorCode": <ERROR_CODE>,
    "errorCodeName": "<ERROR_CODE_NAME>"
  }
}
```

## Heartbeat

- this is a `beta/experimental` feature that is currently being tested
- the heart beat message is periodically sent approximately every 30 seconds on
  the `heartbeat` topic for the
  [Private Data WebSocket](#overview--private-data-websocket-authenticated) API
  and
  [Multi-OrderBook WebSocket)](#overview--multi-orderbook-websocket-unauthenticated)
  API
- the heat beat serves to validate end to end communication between the exchange
  and the client
- if 3 heart beats are missed, then it is advisable to check the
  [official status page](https://bullish.statuspage.io/) for any announcements
  on the degradation of the exchanges features
- if no announcements have been made, it is advisable to disconnect and
  reconnect the websocket API given the issue may be isolated to a specific
  gateway

## Multi-OrderBook WebSocket (unauthenticated)

**Route**

- `/trading-api/v1/market-data/orderbook`

This allows simultaneous subscriptions to multiple L1 and L2 orderbooks of
different markets:

It also provides a heartbeat topic which sends heartbeat every 30s as an
indicator of platform healthiness. Please refer to the
[heartbeat session](#overview--heartbeat) for the details.

### Multi-Orderbook Subscription

## Unified Anonymous Trades WebSocket (unauthenticated)

**Route**

- `/trading-api/v1/market-data/trades`

This allows simultaneous trade subscriptions to multiple markets. Additionally,
instead of sending trades one by one, trades are sent in batches.

Upon subscribing to a market, the client will first receive a snapshot of the
latest 100 trades, followed by batches of trade updates.

### Unified Anonymous Trade Subscription

Anonymous trades from different markets to be subscribed to are controlled by
the parameters in the subscription message listed below: | Parameters | Type |
Description |
|:----------------------|:-------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

`POST /v2/orders`

_Create Order_

Creates an order, requires
[bearer token](#overview--add-authenticated-request-header) in authorization
header.

This endpoint uses the [signing format](#overview--signing-format) which does
not require strict field ordering and addition of null fields in the request
body. Quantities and prices does not require strict precision. Eg. for asset
precision of 4 - `100`, `100.0`, `100.00`, `100.000` and `100.0000` are all
accepted.

**Ratelimited:** `True`. Higher tiers of rate limits available by providing the
`BX-RATELIMIT-TOKEN` request header.

_Order Cancellation Commands_

Submits a command to the trading engine. A successful response indicates that
the command entry was acknowledged but does not indicate that the command was
executed. This endpoint uses the [signing format](#overview--signing-format)
which does not require strict field ordering and addition of null fields in the
request body. Quantities and prices does not require strict precision. Eg. for
asset precision of 4 - `100`, `100.0`, `100.00`, `100.000` and `100.0000` are
all accepted.

Command schemas and examples are provided below. Supported commands:

- V3CancelOrder
- V1CancelAllOrders
- V1CancelAllOrdersByMarket

_Order Amendment Command_

Ability to amend the `price` ,`quantity` and `type` (i.e. change from Taker Only
to Maker only and vice-versa) on Limit orders. It can be applied only to open
orders (`quantityFilled=0` and `status=OPEN`).

This submits a command to the trading engine to amend an order. A successful
response indicates that the command entry was acknowledged but does not indicate
that the command was executed.

This endpoint uses the [signing format](#overview--signing-format) which does
not require strict field ordering and addition of null fields in the request
body. Quantities and prices does not require strict precision. Eg. for asset
precision of 4 - `100`, `100.0`, `100.00`, `100.000` and `100.0000` are all
accepted.

Requires

- [bearer token](#overview--add-authenticated-request-header) in authorization
  header

**Ratelimited:** `True`. Higher tiers of rate limits available by providing the
`BX-RATELIMIT-TOKEN` request header.

_Get Withdrawal Instructions for Crypto_

Get withdrawal instructions added by the user, requires
[bearer token](#overview--add-authenticated-request-header) in authorization
header. Please note that before withdrawal destinations can be used for
withdrawing to, they must be whitelisted on the Bullish website

Please note that Custody endpoints utilize a non-multiplied asset format for
long decimal assets like SHIB and PEPE, ensuring consistency with real-world
asset representation. This differs from Trading endpoints, which use a
multiplied asset format, such as SHIB1M and PEPE1M. For more information, please
see
[help centre](https://bullishexchange.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/BHC/pages/20807684/Understanding+Multiplied+Assets+PEPE1M+and+SHIB1M)

```

`POST /v1/wallets/withdrawal`

_Create Withdrawal_

Trigger a withdrawal, requires
[bearer token](#overview--add-authenticated-request-header) in authorization
header

The `BX-SIGNATURE` header should be created by signing the request with an ECDSA
API Key as follows:

1. Construct a string that concatenates the following fields:
   - `timestamp` - current epoch milliseconds e.g. 1697008474031
   - `nonce` - a UUID identifier to protect against replay attacks e.g.
     255241a1-2cde-4954-87b1-13beef547960
   - `request method` - e.g. POST
   - `request path` - e.g. /trading-api/v1/wallets/withdrawal
   - `request body JSON string`, removing any spaces and newline characters
2. Hash the string using a SHA-256 hash function and sign the resulting
   hexdigest with your `<PRIVATE_KEY>`.
3. DER encode the signature, and BASE64 encode the DER encoded signature.

> **Bullish requires you to whitelist a withdrawal destination address before
> submitting a withdrawal request. You may view, approve, and manage your list
> of destination addresses in Account Settings on the Bullish website. If you
> attempt a withdrawal without first whitelisting an address in Account
> Settings, then the withdrawal attempt will fail.**

For a full example of using the withdrawal endpoint please see the
[Custody Withdrawal Example](https://github.com/bullish-exchange/api-examples/blob/master/ecdsa/rest/custody_withdrawal.py)

Please note that Custody endpoints utilize a non-multiplied asset format for
long decimal assets like SHIB and PEPE, ensuring consistency with real-world
asset representation. This differs from Trading endpoints, which use a
multiplied asset format, such as SHIB1M and PEPE1M. For more information, please
see
[help centre](https://bullishexchange.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/BHC/pages/20807684/Understanding+Multiplied+Assets+PEPE1M+and+SHIB1M)

The currently supported precisions for withdrawal quantities are as follows.
Please note that fees are always specified in units of the symbol itself, not in
smaller denominations (e.g. BTC not Satoshi, ETH not Wei) :
