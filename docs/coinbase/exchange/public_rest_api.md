# Welcome to Exchange APIs

Copy page

FIX 4.2 Order Entry Gateway DeprecationFIX 4.2 Order Entry Gateway will be
deprecated on **June 3rd, 2025**. For FIX based order entry, **leverage the
newer, more performant**
[FIX 5 Order Entry Gateway](/exchange/fix-api/order-entry-messages/order-entry-messages5).

Welcome to Coinbase Exchange API documentation for traders and developers! The
APIs are separated into two categories, trading and market data:

- **Trading APIs** require authentication and let you place orders and access
  account information.
- **Market Data APIs** provide market data and are public.

Coinbase Exchange offers multiple connectivity options tailored to your trading
and data needs:

- [REST API](/exchange/rest-api/requests) for lower-frequency trading and
  general requests.
- [FIX Order Entry API](/exchange/fix-api/order-entry-messages/order-entry-messages5)
  for higher-frequency trading.
- [WebSocket Feed](/exchange/websocket-feed/overview) for market data.
- [FIX Market Data API](/exchange/fix-api/market-data) for latency sensitive
  market data feeds.

Exchange’s developer docs are part of [Coinbase Developer Platform](/), the
single portal from which to access Coinbase’s full suite of APIs and blockchain
infrastructure products.

By accessing the Exchange Market Data API, you agree to be bound by the
[Market Data Terms of Use](https://www.coinbase.com/legal/market_data).

**Order Size Limits Removed**The properties `base_max_size`, `base_min_size`,
`max_market_funds` were
[removed on June 30](/exchange/changes/changelog#2022-jun-30).The property,
`min_market_funds`, has been repurposed as the notional minimum size for limit
orders.

The `base_min_size` and `base_max_size` fields define the min and max order
size. The `min_market_funds` and `max_market_funds` fields define the min and
max funds allowed in a market order. `status_message` provides any extra
information regarding the status if available. The `quote_increment` field
specifies the min order price as well as the price increment. The order price
must be a multiple of this increment (i.e. if the increment is 0.01, order
prices of 0.001 or 0.021 would be rejected). The `base_increment` field
specifies the minimum increment for the `base_currency`. `trading_disabled`
indicates whether trading is currently restricted on this product, this includes
whether both new orders and order cancellations are restricted. `cancel_only`
indicates whether this product only accepts cancel requests for orders.
`post_only` indicates whether only maker orders can be placed. No orders will be
matched when post_only mode is active. `limit_only` indicates whether this
product only accepts limit orders. Only a maximum of one of `trading_disabled`,
`cancel_only`, `post_only`, `limit_only` can be true at once. If none are true,
the product is trading normally. `fx_stablecoin` indicates whether the currency
pair is a Stable Pair. `auction_mode` boolean which indicates whether or not the
book is in auction mode. For more details on the auction mode see
[Get product book](/api-reference/exchange-api/rest-api/products/get-product-book)
describing the level 1 book which contains information pertaining to products in
auction mode.

When limit_only is true, matching can occur if a limit order crosses the book.
Product ID will not change once assigned to a product but all other fields ares
subject to change.

**Order Size Limits Removed**The properties `base_max_size`, `base_min_size`,
`max_market_funds` were
[removed on June 30](/exchange/changes/changelog#2022-jun-30).The property,
`min_market_funds`, has been repurposed as the notional minimum size for limit
orders.

The `base_min_size` and `base_max_size` fields define the min and max order
size. The `min_market_funds` and `max_market_funds` fields define the min and
max funds allowed in a market order. `status_message` provides any extra
information regarding the status if available. The `quote_increment` field
specifies the min order price as well as the price increment. The order price
must be a multiple of this increment (i.e. if the increment is 0.01, order
prices of 0.001 or 0.021 would be rejected). The `base_increment` field
specifies the minimum increment for the `base_currency`. `trading_disabled`
indicates whether trading is currently restricted on this product, this includes
whether both new orders and order cancellations are restricted. `cancel_only`
indicates whether this product only accepts cancel requests for orders.
`post_only` indicates whether only maker orders can be placed. No orders will be
matched when post_only mode is active. `limit_only` indicates whether this
product only accepts limit orders. Only a maximum of one of `trading_disabled`,
`cancel_only`, `post_only`, `limit_only` can be true at once. If none are true,
the product is trading normally. `fx_stablecoin` indicates whether the currency
pair is a Stable Pair. `auction_mode` boolean which indicates whether or not the
book is in auction mode. For more details on the auction mode see
[Get product book](/api-reference/exchange-api/rest-api/products/get-product-book)
describing the level 1 book which contains information pertaining to products in
auction mode.

When limit_only is true, matching can occur if a limit order crosses the book.
Product ID will not change once assigned to a product but all other fields ares
subject to change.
