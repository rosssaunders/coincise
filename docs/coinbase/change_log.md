Welcome to Coinbase Exchange API documentation for traders and developers! The
APIs are separated into two categories, trading and market data:

- **Trading APIs** require authentication and let you place orders and access
  account information.
- **Market Data APIs** provide market data and are public.

Coinbase Exchange offers multiple connectivity options tailored to your trading
and data needs:

- [REST API](/exchange/rest-api/requests) for lower-frequency trading and
  general requests.
- [FIX Order Entry API](/exchange/fix-api/order-entry-messages/order-entry-messages5)
  for higher-frequency trading.
- [WebSocket Feed](/exchange/websocket-feed/overview) for market data.
- [FIX Market Data API](/exchange/fix-api/market-data) for latency sensitive
  market data feeds.

Exchange’s developer docs are part of [Coinbase Developer Platform](/), the
single portal from which to access Coinbase’s full suite of APIs and blockchain
infrastructure products.

By accessing the Exchange Market Data API, you agree to be bound by the
[Market Data Terms of Use](https://www.coinbase.com/legal/market_data).
