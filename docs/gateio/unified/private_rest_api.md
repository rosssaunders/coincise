## [#](#about-apiv4-key-improvement) About APIv4 key improvement

Previously(before April 2020) futures APIv4 key are separated from spot one, but
this is no longer the case anymore. You can create multiple keys with each key
having multiple permissions now. e.g. you can create one key with spot
read/write and futures read/write permission which can be used in both spot and
futures trading.

History API keys will not be affected by this improvement. Previous spot key and
futures key are now one key with only spot permissions enabled, another only
futures permission enabled. You can reconfigure their permissions after
migration.

## [#](#comparison-with-apiv2) Comparison with APIv2

APIv4 is a standalone brand-new HTTP REST API, currently used in parallel with
APIv2. APIv4 provides complete trading operations, with more highly secured
authentication method. What's more, APIv4 specification is written following
[OpenAPI Specification (opens new window)](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.2.md).
SDKs and documents are all generated from the same spec, which ensures
consistency between documents and implementation.

The ways APIv4 and APIv2 differ are:

1.  Their API keys are separated from each other. Once logged into the web
    console, v2 API keys are generated on _"APIKeys"_ page, while v4
    _"APIv4Keys"_ page.
2.  APIv2 supports only spot trading, while v4 supports all trading operations
    in spot, margin and futures.

Which one to choose:

1.  If margin or futures trading are needed, choose APIv4.
2.  If only spot trading or wallet operation is required, choose on your own.

## [#](#matching-mechanism) Matching mechanism

### [#](#matching-priority) Matching priority

Gate.io Order matching follows Price Priority > Time priority principle.

Suppose that the order book is as follows：

| Order | Order time | Ask/Selling price |
| ----- | ---------- | ----------------- |
| A     | 10:00      | 100               |
| B     | 10:00      | 102               |
| C     | 10:01      | 100               |

If the current price of 10:02 pays 102, the final transaction order is: A, C, B

### [#](#order-life-cycle) Order life cycle

A valid order sent to the matching engine is immediately confirmed and executed
with existing orders, with the executing result sent back to the client.

If an order is fully executed, then it is closed. If any part of the order is
not executed immediately, orders with TimeInForce set to `IOC` will be
cancelled, while others will be appended to the price list, waiting for
subsequent filling or being cancelled.

## [#](#margin-migration-instructions) Margin Migration Instructions

Between 14:00 (UTC+8) on April 13, 2023 and 14:00 (UTC+8) on April 23, 2023, the
platform will gradually migrate the assets that have not been borrowed in the
lending market to the `Lend & Earn` through an automated system process. At the
same time, assets that have already been borrowed will be cancelled for
automatic lending. After the migration is complete, you can check your
investment details in the `Lend & Earn`. During this period, borrowing funds
through the lending market will be temporarily suspended. You can also manually
transfer your assets from the lending market to the `Lend & Earn` to obtain
investment returns in advance.

After the automatic migration, the old version of the borrowing and lending
endpoint will be deprecated, and the new version of the endpoint can be found in
the /margin/uni endpoint group. For detailed endpoint migration, please refer to
the following table:"

# [#](#api) API

## [#](#http-convention) HTTP convention

- All read endpoints use `GET` method. They accept only request parameters. No
  request body will be read.
- `DELETE` methods remove resources(like orders), but not all removing operation
  using `DELETE`, as `DELETE`s don't read request body either. For complex
  removing operations, `POST` method is used with parameters filled in request
  body.
- Updating is done using `POST`, `PUT` or `PATCH` method. Their parameters are
  either in body or request parameters for different endpoints. Refer to
  endpoint detail for how to send the request.
- All endpoints return HTTP status code `2xx` on success. `401` is returned on
  authentication failure. Other `4xx` codes mean the request is malformed. `5xx`
  means the server encounter some critical error on processing the request.
  Commit issues if `5xx` is met.

## [#](#time) Time

All time related fields are unix timestamp in **seconds** if no extra note, but
they may differ in formats(int64, number or string). Possible values like the
following may be returned:

- 1596531048
- "1596531048"
- 1596531048.285
- "1596531048.285"

The best way to handle time fields is parsing them as a number with decimal
places. If higher precision is not needed, you can safely cast them to
integer(or long). Our SDKs listed above has already taken proper deserialization
to handle them

## [#](#api-gateway-in-out-time) API Gateway in/out time

In every API request, the response header will always include the following
fields:

- `X-In-Time`: The timestamp when the API gateway receives a request, in Unix
  timestamp format, measured in microseconds.
- `X-Out-Time`: The timestamp when the API gateway returns a response, in Unix
  timestamp format, measured in microseconds.

For example:

```
X-In-Time: 1695715091540163
X-Out-Time: 1695715091551905
```

## [#](#pagination) Pagination

Pagination is achieved using one of the following method

- `page-limit`
- `limit-offset`

In both method, `limit` limits the maximum number of records returned in one
request. If no additional explanation, it defaults to `100` if not provided and
its maximum value is limited to `1000`.

`page` starts from `1`, mimicking common paging used in web pages. To iterate
the whole list, use the same `limit` and increment `page` by `1` until the
records' length is shorter than the `limit`

`offset` starts from `0`, behaving like common DB search. To iterate the whole
list, increment `offset` by `limit` until the records' length is shorter than
the `limit`.

For example, if the total number of orders is 201. Using page-limit method, send
request parameters like the following:

1.  `page=1&limit=100`
2.  `page=2&limit=100`
3.  `page=3&limit=100`

Using limit-offset method, send request parameters like:

1.  `limit=100&offset=0`
2.  `limit=100&offset=100`
3.  `limit=100&offset=200`

Some endpoints may return additional pagination metadata. If present, they are
sent back through the response header. Take `GET /futures/{settle}/orders` as an
example, following headers will be returned

- `X-Pagination-Limit`: request limit
- `X-Pagination-Offset`: request offset
- `X-Pagination-Total`: total record number satisfying the request

  endpoint
- X-Gate-RateLimit-Limit - your current limit for current endpoint
- X-Gate-RateLimit-Reset-Timestamp - the timestamp indicating when your request
  limit resets if you have exceeded your rate_limit. Otherwise, this is just the
  current timestamp (it may not exactly match timeNow).

## [#](#rate-limit-based-on-fill-ratio) Rate Limit Based On Fill Ratio

In order to enhance trading efficiency, we have decided to implement more
favorable sub-account rate limits for clients with a higher fill ratio. This
assessment will be based on trading data from the past seven days and will be
calculated daily at 00:00 UTC. Please note that this rule applies only to
clients at **VIP level 14 and above**.

### [#](#_1-introduction-of-terminology) 1. Introduction of Terminology

#### [#](#_1-1-symbol-multiplier) 1.1 Symbol Multiplier

To facilitate a more refined management of the impact of different trading
products on the fill ratio, we have introduced the concept of the symbol
multiplier. This multiplier allows us to adjust the influence of each product on
the overall trading volume based on its characteristics. For products with a
multiplier of less than 1, they typically involve smaller contract sizes and
therefore require more trading orders to achieve the same trading volume.
Generally, all trading products come with a default multiplier; however, certain
products are assigned independent multipliers based on their specific
characteristics. For detailed information regarding the multipliers of relevant
products, please refer to the provided table.

| Product Typee                    | Based On        | Independnet Symbol Multiplier | Default Symbol Multiplier |
| -------------------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| USDT-Margined Perpetural Futures | Contract Symbol | 1                             |

#### [#](#_1-2-definition-of-trading-volume-weight) 1.2 Definition of Trading Volume Weight

We will assess the behavior patterns of makers and takers based on market
fluctuations and design the trading volume weight ratios accordingly.
Additionally, we will regularly evaluate these weights and make synchronized
adjustments when necessary.

**Current weight of the maker trading volume: 100%, current weight of the taker
trading volume: 90%.**

#### [#](#_1-3-calculation-formula) 1.3 Calculation Formula

The system will take a snapshot of the data at 00:00 UTC daily and, based on
this information, will select the higher value between the fill ratio of the
sub-account and the overall fill ratio of the main account to determine the
future trading rate limit for the sub-account. For exchange brokers, the system
will only consider the fill ratio of their sub-accounts. It is important to note
that the main account is also considered a "sub-account."

1.  Sub-account Fill Ratio: This ratio is calculated as follows: (Sub-account
    Taker's USDT trading volume × 0.9 + Maker's USDT trading volume × 1) / (The
    sum of (Number of new and modified requests for each contract × symbol
    multipliers) for each subaccount).
2.  Main-account Aggregated Fill Ratio: This ratio is calculated as follows:
    (main account's Taker USDT trading volume × 0.9 + Maker USDT trading volume
    × 1) / (The sum of (Number of new and modified requests for each contract ×
    symbol multipliers) for all subaccounts).

### [#](#_3-detailed-rules-for-fill-ratio) 3. Detailed Rules for Fill Ratio

1.  Target Client Group: VIP ≥ 14
2.  Calculation Period: 7 days
3.  Update Time: Daily at 08:00 (UTC). The system will update the fill ratio
    data based on the data from 00:00 UTC.
    1.  If the fill ratio and the pre-set rate limit improve, the increase will
        take effect immediately at 08:00 (UTC).
    2.  However, if the fill ratio declines, the rate limit will be reduced
        immediately.
    3.  If a client's VIP level drops below VIP 14, their rate limit will be
        lowered to the minimum tier, taking effect immediately.
    4.  If a client's VIP level rises above VIP 14, their rate limit will be
        adjusted immediately based on their current level.
    5.  If a sub-account's trading volume over the past 7 days is below
        1,000,000 USDT, the rate limit will be implemented based on the
        main-account aggregated fill ratio.
    6.  For newly created sub-accounts, the minimum tier rate limit will be
        applied at the time of creation, and the aforementioned rate limit rules
        will begin to apply at T+1 08:00 (UTC).
    7.  Both WebSocket and REST APIs are subject to these rules.

### [#](#_4-example) 4. Example

Assuming the client has three accounts, with the symbol multipliers for trading
perpetual contract products BTC-USDT and SOL-USDT being 1 and 0.4, respectively.

1.  Account A (Main Account):
    - BTC-USDT perpetual futures Maker trading volume: 100 USDT, number of order
      requests: 10; Perpetual futures Taker trading volume: 200 USDT, number of
      order requests: 20.
    - SOL-USDT perpetual futures Maker trading volume: 20 USDT, number of order
      requests: 15; Perpetual futures Taker trading volume: 20 USDT, number of
      order requests: 20.
    - Sub-account Fill Ratio = ((100 + 20) \* 1 + (200 + 20) \* 0.9) /
      ((10 + 20) \* 1 + (15 + 20) \* 0.4) = 7.23
2.  Account B (Sub-account):
    - BTC-USDT perpetual futures Maker trading volume: 200 USDT, number of order
      requests: 20; Perpetual futures Taker trading volume: 200 USDT, number of
      order requests: 30.
    - SOL-USDT perpetual futures Maker trading volume: 20 USDT, number of order
      requests: 5; Perpetual futures Taker trading volume: 30 USDT, number of
      order requests: 5.
    - Sub-account Fill Ratio = ((200 + 20) \* 1 + (200 + 30) \* 0.9) /
      ((20 + 30) \* 1 + (5 + 5) \* 0.4) = 7.91
3.  Account C (Sub-account):
    - BTC-USDT perpetual futures Maker trading volume: 50 USDT, number of order
      requests: 5; Perpetual futures Taker trading volume: 60 USDT, number of
      order requests: 8.
    - SOL-USDT perpetual futures Maker trading volume: 100 USDT, number of order
      requests: 20; Perpetual futures Taker trading volume: 120 USDT, number of
      order requests: 25.
    - Sub-account Fill Ratio = ((50 + 100) \* 1 + (60 + 120) \* 0.9) /
      ((5 + 8) \* 1 + (20 + 25) \* 0.4) = 10.06
4.  Main Account Aggregated Fill Ratio = ((100 + 20 + 200 + 20 + 50 + 100) \*
    1 + (200 + 20 + 200 + 30 + 60 + 120) \* 0.9) / ((10 + 20 + 20 + 30 +
    5 + 8) \* 1 + (15 + 20 + 5 + 5 + 20 + 25) \* 0.4) = 8.19
5.  Account Rate Limits:
    - Account A = max(7.23, 8.19) = 8.19 -> 250 r/s
    - Account B = max(7.91, 8.19) = 8.19 -> 250 r/s
    - Account C = max(10.06, 8.19) = 10.06 -> 300 r/s

### [#](#_5-remarks) 5. Remarks

1.  The release date for the rate limit of perpetual contracts based on fill
    ratio will be announced later. Please stay tuned.
2.  The existing abuse rate limit rules for perpetual contracts will still
    apply, namely:
    1.  Fill Ratio = USDT Training Amount / (Total Number of Order,
        Cancellation, and Modification Requests)
    2.  If the number of requests exceeds 86,400 within 24 hours, with no order
        fill in the same period. Then the order placement rate limit will be
        restricted to 10r/10s for the next hour.
    3.  If the number of requests exceeds 86,400 within 24 hours, with the fill
        ratio below 1%. Then the order placement rate limit will be restricted
        to 20r/10s for the next hour.
3.  Please stay tuned for the fill ratio rate limit for spot trading.

## [#](#portfolio-margin-account) Portfolio Margin Account

TIP

The Portfolio Margin Account is no longer maintained, please refer to the new
version of the [Unified Account](#unified-account)

Since version `4.25.0`, we start supporting portfolio margin account. Gate.io's
Portfolio Margin Account is a new feature of Gate.io's trading system. Its main
function is to break the capital isolation between cross-margin leverage account
and USD cross-margin perpetual contract account inside a Classic Account and
achieve the multi-currency margin sharing among multi-product lines. Thanks to
the margin sharing, users don't need to transfer funds between the two accounts,
and the profit and loss of positions among different trading products can offset
each other and effectively improve the capital utilization rate. See more
details in the
[Help Center](/help/trade/leveraged/26421/introductions-to-gate.io-s-portfolio-margin-account)

Before using the portfolio margin account's API key, you should create the API
key on the API management page. The API key supports spot and perpetual
contracts trading only.

> If permissions of the API key can't be checked, ensure your cross-margin
> account has available balance first.

### [#](#transfer) Transfer

The classic account and portfolio margin account are two different capital
isolation accounts. If you want to achieve multi-currency margin sharing among
multi-product lines, use the portfolio margin account please.

The funds of the portfolio margin account come from the classic account. Due to
the change of funds in the classic account, the transfer of funds can only be
performed using the API Key of the classic account.

The portfolio margin account is upgraded based on the cross-margin account of
the original classic account, so the classic account only needs to transfer its
spot funds to the cross-margin account to deposit the portfolio margin account.
Similarly, withdrawals from portfolio margin account can be achieved by the
classic account performing transferals from the cross margin to its spot
account.

The API Key of the portfolio margin account can only perform transferals among
its own multiple accounts. Due to the sharing of margin, the portfolio margin
account does not need to transfer funds to its futures account (we also restrict
doing so). If the futures account has PNL funds that need to be withdrawn, it
must be transferred by the portfolio margin account's API key to its
cross-margin account first, so that the classic account can perform withdrawals
from portfolio margin account.

### [#](#spot-trading) Spot trading

The spot trading of the portfolio margin account is almost the same as the
classic account, except that `cross_margin` must be specified in the `account`
parameter when placing orders. For example, if you want to place a buy order for
the `BTC_USDT` currency pair, the order request will be similar to

```
POST /spot/orders

{
  "currency_pair": "BTC_USDT",
  "account": "cross_margin",
  "side": "buy",
  ...
}
```

For other related restrictions, please refer to the document of the API endpoint
directly.

TIP

It should be noted that the portfolio margin account is upgraded from the
classic account's cross-margin account. The API Key of the classic account
originally supports the operation of the cross-margin account. In order not to
affect the existing operations of the classic account, we still retain this
function of the classic account. So whether it is the API Key of the classic
account or the portfolio margin account, both can operate the same the cross
margin account (note that the futures accounts are separate)

### [#](#futures-trading) Futures trading

The API operation of the perpetual contract of the portfolio margin account is
exactly the same as that of the classic account, but currently only supports USD
settlement

TIP

In the futures trading, it should be noted that there is no compatibility for
cross-margin accounts like using the API Key of the classic account in spot
trading. Therefore, when using the API Key of the classic account for futures
trading, assets are kept under `classic account-futures`, and when using
portfolio margin account API Key for futures trading, assets are kept under
`portfolio margin account-futures`. These two are different futures accounts. In
addition, funds under `classic account-spot` cannot share margin with
`classic account-futures`.

## [#](#trace-id) Trace ID

The API response will carry the header: X-Gate-Trace-ID . This header is used
for tracking.

## [#](#self-trade-prevention-stp) Self-Trade Prevention (STP)

### [#](#concepts) Concepts

**Self-Trade Prevention**: STP will prevent any user's orders from being matched
with each other.

**CN**: Cancel new, Cancel new orders and keep old ones.

**CO**: Cancel old, Cancel old orders and keep new ones.

**CB**: Cancel both, Both old and new orders will be cancelled.

### [#](#stp-strategies) STP Strategies

We support three STP strategies, which are `CN` , `CO` and `CB`.

STP is achieved by adding users to one STP trading group. When a user in a STP
group place orders, and trading could happen with existing orders of users in
the same group, orders will be cancelled. The prevention strategy depends on the
`stp_act` parameter specified when placing the order as taker. If not specified,
the `CN` strategy will be used by default.

A user has to be added to a STP trading group before using STP. When a user does
not belong to any STP trading group, and place orders with the `stp_act`
parameter, the orders will be rejected.

### [#](#api-parameter-adjustment) API Parameter Adjustment

Take placing futures order as an example:

```
POST /futures/{settle}/orders
```

New request body parameter:

| Name    | Position | Type   | Required | Description                |
| ------- | -------- | ------ | -------- | -------------------------- |
| stp_act | body     | string | No       | STP Strategies, including: |

\- cn  
\- co  
\- cb |

New response fields:

| Name    | Type   | Required | Restriction | Description                 |
| ------- | ------ | -------- | ----------- | --------------------------- |
| stp_act | string | No       | none        | STP Strategies, including： |

\- cn  
\- co  
\- cb | | stp_id | integer(int64) | No | readonly | The ID of the STP trading
group to which user belongs. | | finish_as | string | No | readonly | order
finish type:  
\- **stp: The order has been canceled due to the `STP`** |

### [#](#user-case) User case

There are multiple accounts under `Organization A`, and the IDs of several
accounts are `101`, `102`, and `103`

In order to prevent self-trading of orders placed by internal accounts of the
organization, the administrator created a STP trading group with group ID `100`,
and added accounts `101` and `102` to the STP trading group. In this case, the
members in the group are `[101,102]`.

T1: The `STP` strategy version released.

T2: After the `organization A` account `101` places a short order, there is no
matching order in the market order book to match the transaction. At this time,
the role of the order is `maker`, and the order status is `open`. The key
response fields returned are:

```
{
	"status":"open",
	"stp_act":"cn",
	"stp_id":100
}
```

T3: `Organization A` account `101`/`102` places a long order, and it can reach a
trade with account 101’s short order. The match engine finds both two orders'
stp_id are 100, so it applies the STP strategy of the taker order, which
defaults to `cn` , and cancels the long order. Order's `finish_as` will be set
to `stp`. The key response fields returned are:

```
{
	"status":"finished",
	"stp_act":"cn",
	"stp_id":100,
	"finish_as":"stp"
}
```

- If `stp_act` is `co` , the order placed by `taker` will be retained, the order
  status will be `open`, and the system will cancel the order of `maker`.
- If `stp_act` is `cb`, both the long and short orders will be cancelled.
  Orders' `finish_as` will be set to `stp`. The key response fields returned
  are:

```
{
	"status":"finished",
	"stp_act":"cb",
	"stp_id":100,
	"finish_as":"stp"
}
```

T3': If account 103 places a long order, and it can reach a trade with account
101’s short order, the transaction will be made since account 103 has not been
added to account 101’s STP group. The key response fields returned are:

```
{
	"status":"finished",
	"stp_id":0,
	"finish_as":"filled"
}
```

## [#](#unified-account) Unified Account

### [#](#description) Description

Once a user upgrades their account to the unified account, they can utilize the
assets from their spot account as collateral for trading. The assets in the
account, denominated in various currencies, will be adjusted based on their
liquidity and converted to USD for consistent calculation of the account's
assets and position value.

The maximum borrowing limit for margin trading represents the maximum amount
that a user can borrow for a given trading market. The platform calculates the
user's maximum borrowing limit based on factors such as available margin and
platform risk control rules. Once the margin trading generates automatic
borrowing, the platform immediately starts accruing interest on the borrowed
digital assets.

Currently, the ability to switch to `cross_margin` or`usdt_futures` mode is
available. In the future, we will gradually introduce support for various
combination margin accounts, including `Futures`, `Delivery`, `Options` and
more. Stay tuned for further updates.

Please refer to the documentation for unified API. Once you have upgraded your
account, you will be able to make use of these endpoints.

Related endpoint can be found in the Unified Account API doc. After enabling the
Unified Account, you can proceed to call them. For more detailed information,
please refer to [here](https://www.gate.io/unified-trading-account)

### [#](#api-integration-process) API Integration Process

- Create a new `API KEY` or update the permissions of an existing `API KEY`,
  checking the `unified` permission
- Use the classic account's `API KEY` to call the
  `POST /api/v4/unified/account_mode` endpoint, or upgrade from the WEB page to
  the Unified Account
- Use the `/api/v4/spot/**` API for spot-related operations (ordering, modifying
  orders, querying orders), with the `account=unified` option
- Use the `/api/v4/futures/**` API for perpetual futures-related operations
  (ordering, modifying orders, querying orders)
- Use the `/api/v4/unified/**` API for Unified Account-related operations
  (account querying, loan querying)

### [#](#spot-trading-2) SPOT Trading

The spot trading in the Unified Account is consistent with that in the classical
account. In order operations, specify `account=unified`, or specify
`account=spot` and the system will automatically handle the order as a unified
account order when detecting the account as a unified account. For example, to
place a buy order for the `BTC_USDT` currency pair, the order creation request
would be similar to

```
POST /spot/orders

{
  "currency_pair": "BTC_USDT",
  "account": "unified",
  "side": "buy",
  ...
}
```

For other related restrictions, please refer to the document of the API endpoint
directly.

## [#](#error-handling) Error Handling

For all abnormal requests, APIv4 will return non-2xx status code, with a
response body in JSON format to explain the error.

The error response body follows a format like:

```
{
  "label": "INVALID_PARAM_VALUE",
  "message": "Invalid parameter `text` with value: abc"
}
```

- `label`: denotes error type in `string` format. Its value are chosen from a
  certain list(see below). Programs can use `label` to identify and catch a
  specific error.
- `message`(or `detail`): detailed error message. A longer explanation showing
  why the error is generated or how to avoid it. Its purpose is helping to
  better understand the API. Error handling mechanism with this field is highly
  **NOT** recommended.

Take Python
[requests (opens new window)](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for
example, error handling can be written like:

> Following examples only deal with business-related errors. Network timeout or
> other common errors need to be handled separately:

or with
[Python SDK (opens new window)](https://github.com/gateio/gateapi-python):

Before calling the private API interface, the API key of the account needs to be
generated to verify the identity. You can log in on the website and generate it
in \[account management\] - > \[APIv4 keys\], or click
[here](/myaccount/apiv4keys) to generate API keys.

Each account can create 20 API keys, and the permission configuration of each
key is independent of each other. It is recommended to set a note name for each
key to indicate its purpose.

**`Key`** Access Key **`Secret Key`** The key used for signature authentication
encryption

Besides, you can attach an IP whitelist, which requires the server only accept
requests from specified IPs. Each key can have at most 20 IPs formatted in
IPv4(not supporting IP range though). If IP whitelist is not set, the server
will skip client IP validation.

Each user can create at most 5 keys with separate permissions. It is recommended
to set a name for key denoting how the key will be used.

TIP

Note: If the key is named with `spot` or `futures`, then it could be the default
name after APIv4 migration. For details refer to _About APIv4 key improvement_
section

Created key can also be updated or deleted, but any modification(s) can take up
to 5 minutes to take effect.

Please note that futures TestNet trading is a separate environment from futures
real trading. Real trading API keys cannot be used in TestNet. If you want to
test futures API with TestNet, you need to log into the console to generate
TestNet API keys(in _"Futures TestNet APIKeys"_ tab on _" APIv4Keys"_ page).
Making futures requests are identical between real and TestNet trading, with the
only exceptions are different base URLs and different API keys.

## [#](#apiv4-permissions) APIv4 Permissions

When creating a Key, you can configure whether to enable spot, margin, contract,
wallet, or withdrawal permissions for the Key, and whether to enable read-write
or read-only permissions.

| Products             | Permissions                                                                                               |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `spot/margin`        | `Read-only` query orders `Read-write` query orders & place orders                                         |
| `perpetual contract` | `Read-only` query orders `Read-write` query orders & place orders                                         |
| `delivery contract`  | `Read-only` query orders `Read-write` query orders & place orders                                         |
| `wallet`             | `Read-only` Query for withdrawal transfer records `Read-write` Query for account records & fund transfers |
| `withdrawal`         | `Read-only` Query cash withdrawal records `Read-write` Query cash withdrawal records & withdrawals        |

All `GET` operations are read requests, while others are write requests. Each
permission group can be set to disabled, read-only or read-write.

Please note that even though withdrawal API has only one operation(i.e.
`POST /withdrawals`), for general concern, it is still separated from wallet API
into a standalone permission group, while withdrawal history retrieving API
stays inside wallet operations( i.e., `GET /wallet/withdrawals`).

## [#](#apiv4-signed-request-requirements) APIv4 signed request requirements

1.  Generate APIv4 Key pairs in web console, and make sure it has the right
    permissions.
2.  Set request header `KEY` to the key.
3.  Set request header `Timestamp` to current time formatted in Unix time in
    seconds. Pay attention that the gap between its value and current time
    cannot exceed 60 seconds.
4.  Set request header `SIGN` to encrypted request signature. Refer to next
    section for how signature string is generated. Signature generation method
    is `HexEncode(HMAC_SHA512(secret, signature_string))`, i.e., the hexadecimal
    digest output of HMAC-SHA512 with APIv4 secret as secret and signature
    string as message,
5.  Make sure request client's IP is in your APIv4 Key's IP whitelist.

## [#](#api-signature-string-generation) API Signature string generation

In APIv4, signature string is concatenated as the following way:

`Request Method + "\n" + Request URL + "\n" + Query String + "\n" + HexEncode(SHA512(Request Payload)) + "\n" + Timestamp`

### [#](#request-method) Request Method

Request method in UPPERCASE, e.g. `POST`, `GET`

### [#](#request-url) Request URL

Request url. Protocol, host and port are not included, e.g.
`/api/v4/futures/orders`

### [#](#query-string) Query String

Request query string without URL encode. query parameters order should be the
same as how they are concatenated in the request URL, e.g.
`status=finished&limit=50`. Use empty string("") if no query parameters.

### [#](#hexencode-sha512-request-payload) HexEncode(SHA512(Request Payload))

Hash the request body with SHA512 and output its Hex encoded form. If no request
body, use empty string's hashed result, i.e.
`cf83e1357eefb8bdf1542850d66d8007d620e4050b5715dc83f4a921d36ce9ce47d0d13c5d85f2b0ff8318d2877eec2f63b931bd47417a81a538327af927da3e`

### [#](#timestamp) Timestamp

`Timestamp` request header value.

Examples

Note: all example signature string are broken into multiple lines for displaying
purpose only. Only the `\n` character in signature string is reserved in
reality.

Suppose the key we used is `key`, while the secret is `secret`.

1.  List all orders

```
	GET /api/v4/futures/orders?contract=BTC_USD&status=finished&limit=50 HTTP/1.1
```

Signature string：

```
	GET\n
	/api/v4/futures/orders\n
	contract=BTC_USD&status=finished&limit=50\n
	cf83e1357eefb8bdf1542850d66d8007d620e4050b5715dc83f4a921d36ce9ce47d0d13c5d85f2b0ff8318d2877eec2f63b931bd47417a81a538327af927da3e\n
	1541993715
```

Explanation：

- `/api/v4/futures/orders`: request url
- `contract=BTC_USD&status=finished&limit=50`: keep the query string as it is in
  the request url
- request body use empty string's hashed result
- `1541993715`: Unix timestamp in seconds

Signature generated

`55f84ea195d6fe57ce62464daaa7c3c02fa9d1dde954e4c898289c9a2407a3d6fb3faf24deff16790d726b66ac9f74526668b13bd01029199cc4fcc522418b8a`

2.  Create an order

```
	POST /api/v4/futures/orders HTTP/1.1

	{"contract":"BTC_USD","type":"limit","size":100,"price":6800,"time_in_force":"gtc"}
```

Signature string：

```
	POST\n
	/api/v4/futures/orders\n
	\n
	ad3c169203dc3026558f01b4df307641fa1fa361f086b2306658886d5708767b1854797c68d9e62fef2f991645aa82673622ebf417e091d0bd22bafe5d956cca\n
	1541993715
```

Explanation：

- request query string is empty, use plain empty string
- use the hashed result of the json-string-formatted request body

# [#](#faq) FAQ

- How to retrieve `POST /wallet/transfers` history?

  Records of transfers generated through `POST /wallet/transfers` has multiple
  methods to be retrieved based on account, including:

  - `GET /margin/account_book` to retrieve transferals from or to margin
    account.
  - `GET /futures/{settle}/account_book?type=dnw` to retrieve perpetual contract
    account history
  - `GET /delivery/{settle}/account_book?type=dnw` to retrieve delivery contract
    account history

- How to create margin orders?

  Margin order creation has been merged into spot order APIs. In
  `POST /spot/orders` or `POST /spot/batch_orders`, set `account` to `margin` to
  create margin orders.

- Futures operation returns error `USER_NOT_FOUND`

  Futures account is not initialized yet. Making a deposit to your futures
  account will help. Note that each settle currency is associated with an
  independent futures account.

- Futures operation returns error `CONTRACT_NOT_FOUND`

  Every settle currency has its own contract list. Make sure the contract you
  specified is supported by the settle currency. You can query the list with

  `GET /futures/{settle}/contracts` or `GET /delivery/{settle}/contracts`

- Difference between sub account and main account

  - Sub account API Key cannot operate transferals between main and sub account,
    i.e., `POST /wallet/sub_account_transfers`
  - Sub account API Key cannot operate withdrawal, i.e., `POST /withdrawals`
  - If sub account does not have some business permission, even if its API key
    has the permission, the operations will be rejected too.

- I have other question(s) not covered above

  Contact support for the issue. If the problem is related to one of the SDKs,
  you can also open an issue in the corresponding GitHub repository.

  When submitting an issue, please include the following information to help
  identify the problem:

  - User ID
    - Original request URL, request parameters and request body
    - What API key was used and where was it used, TestNet or real trading(API
      secret is not needed)
    - Programming language. Providing a code snippet will be better
    - Whether SDK was used. If so, which method caused the problem

# [#](#unified) Unified

The assets of each currency in the account will be adjusted according to their
liquidity, defined by corresponding adjustment coefficients, and then uniformly
converted to USD to calculate the total asset value and position value of the
account.

You can refer to the [Formula](#portfolio-account) in the documentation

## [#](#borrow-or-repay) Borrow or repay

> Code samples

`POST /unified/loans`

_Borrow or repay_

When borrowing, it is essential to ensure that the borrowed amount is not below
the minimum borrowing threshold for the specific cryptocurrency and does not
exceed the maximum borrowing limit set by the platform and the user.

The interest on the loan will be automatically deducted from the account at
regular intervals. It is the user's responsibility to manage the repayment of
the borrowed amount.

For repayment, the option to repay the entire borrowed amount is available by
setting the parameter `repaid_all=true`

> Body parameter

```
{
  "currency": "BTC",
  "amount": "0.1",
  "type": "borrow",
  "repaid_all": false,
  "text": "t-test"
}
