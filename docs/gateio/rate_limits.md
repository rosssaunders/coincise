**Rate Limit**

Each request to the API response header will contain the following fields::

- X-Gate-RateLimit-Requests-Remain - your remaining requests for current
  endpoint
- X-Gate-RateLimit-Limit - your current limit for current endpoint
- X-Gate-RateLimit-Reset-Timestamp - the timestamp indicating when your request
  limit resets if you have exceeded your rate_limit. Otherwise, this is just the
  current timestamp (it may not exactly match timeNow).

## [#](#rate-limit-based-on-fill-ratio) Rate Limit Based On Fill Ratio

In order to enhance trading efficiency, we have decided to implement more
favorable sub-account rate limits for clients with a higher fill ratio. This
assessment will be based on trading data from the past seven days and will be
calculated daily at 00:00 UTC. Please note that this rule applies only to
clients at **VIP level 14 and above**.

### [#](#_1-introduction-of-terminology) 1. Introduction of Terminology

#### [#](#_1-1-symbol-multiplier) 1.1 Symbol Multiplier

To facilitate a more refined management of the impact of different trading
products on the fill ratio, we have introduced the concept of the symbol
multiplier. This multiplier allows us to adjust the influence of each product on
the overall trading volume based on its characteristics. For products with a
multiplier of less than 1, they typically involve smaller contract sizes and
therefore require more trading orders to achieve the same trading volume.
Generally, all trading products come with a default multiplier; however, certain
products are assigned independent multipliers based on their specific
characteristics. For detailed information regarding the multipliers of relevant
products, please refer to the provided table.

| Product Typee                    | Based On        | Independnet Symbol Multiplier | Default Symbol Multiplier |
| -------------------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| USDT-Margined Perpetural Futures | Contract Symbol | 1                             |

Contract Symbol:  
BTC-USDT  
ETH-USDT | 0.4 | | Spot | Currency Pairst | 1  
Currency Pairs:  
BTC-USDT  
ETH-USDT | 0.4 |

> Please note: The spot trading rate limits will not be launched this time.

#### [#](#_1-2-definition-of-trading-volume-weight) 1.2 Definition of Trading Volume Weight

We will assess the behavior patterns of makers and takers based on market
fluctuations and design the trading volume weight ratios accordingly.
Additionally, we will regularly evaluate these weights and make synchronized
adjustments when necessary.

**Current weight of the maker trading volume: 100%, current weight of the taker
trading volume: 90%.**

#### [#](#_1-3-calculation-formula) 1.3 Calculation Formula

The system will take a snapshot of the data at 00:00 UTC daily and, based on
this information, will select the higher value between the fill ratio of the
sub-account and the overall fill ratio of the main account to determine the
future trading rate limit for the sub-account. For exchange brokers, the system
will only consider the fill ratio of their sub-accounts. It is important to note
that the main account is also considered a "sub-account."

1.  Sub-account Fill Ratio: This ratio is calculated as follows: (Sub-account
    Taker's USDT trading volume × 0.9 + Maker's USDT trading volume × 1) / (The
    sum of (Number of new and modified requests for each contract × symbol
    multipliers) for each subaccount).
2.  Main-account Aggregated Fill Ratio: This ratio is calculated as follows:
    (main account's Taker USDT trading volume × 0.9 + Maker USDT trading volume
    × 1) / (The sum of (Number of new and modified requests for each contract ×
    symbol multipliers) for all subaccounts).

### [#](#_3-detailed-rules-for-fill-ratio) 3. Detailed Rules for Fill Ratio

1.  Target Client Group: VIP ≥ 14
2.  Calculation Period: 7 days
3.  Update Time: Daily at 08:00 (UTC). The system will update the fill ratio
    data based on the data from 00:00 UTC.
    1.  If the fill ratio and the pre-set rate limit improve, the increase will
        take effect immediately at 08:00 (UTC).
    2.  However, if the fill ratio declines, the rate limit will be reduced
        immediately.
    3.  If a client's VIP level drops below VIP 14, their rate limit will be
        lowered to the minimum tier, taking effect immediately.
    4.  If a client's VIP level rises above VIP 14, their rate limit will be
        adjusted immediately based on their current level.
    5.  If a sub-account's trading volume over the past 7 days is below
        1,000,000 USDT, the rate limit will be implemented based on the
        main-account aggregated fill ratio.
    6.  For newly created sub-accounts, the minimum tier rate limit will be
        applied at the time of creation, and the aforementioned rate limit rules
        will begin to apply at T+1 08:00 (UTC).
    7.  Both WebSocket and REST APIs are subject to these rules.

### [#](#_4-example) 4. Example

Assuming the client has three accounts, with the symbol multipliers for trading
perpetual contract products BTC-USDT and SOL-USDT being 1 and 0.4, respectively.

1.  Account A (Main Account):
    - BTC-USDT perpetual futures Maker trading volume: 100 USDT, number of order
      requests: 10; Perpetual futures Taker trading volume: 200 USDT, number of
      order requests: 20.
    - SOL-USDT perpetual futures Maker trading volume: 20 USDT, number of order
      requests: 15; Perpetual futures Taker trading volume: 20 USDT, number of
      order requests: 20.
    - Sub-account Fill Ratio = ((100 + 20) \* 1 + (200 + 20) \* 0.9) /
      ((10 + 20) \* 1 + (15 + 20) \* 0.4) = 7.23
2.  Account B (Sub-account):
    - BTC-USDT perpetual futures Maker trading volume: 200 USDT, number of order
      requests: 20; Perpetual futures Taker trading volume: 200 USDT, number of
      order requests: 30.
    - SOL-USDT perpetual futures Maker trading volume: 20 USDT, number of order
      requests: 5; Perpetual futures Taker trading volume: 30 USDT, number of
      order requests: 5.
    - Sub-account Fill Ratio = ((200 + 20) \* 1 + (200 + 30) \* 0.9) /
      ((20 + 30) \* 1 + (5 + 5) \* 0.4) = 7.91
3.  Account C (Sub-account):
    - BTC-USDT perpetual futures Maker trading volume: 50 USDT, number of order
      requests: 5; Perpetual futures Taker trading volume: 60 USDT, number of
      order requests: 8.
    - SOL-USDT perpetual futures Maker trading volume: 100 USDT, number of order
      requests: 20; Perpetual futures Taker trading volume: 120 USDT, number of
      order requests: 25.
    - Sub-account Fill Ratio = ((50 + 100) \* 1 + (60 + 120) \* 0.9) /
      ((5 + 8) \* 1 + (20 + 25) \* 0.4) = 10.06
4.  Main Account Aggregated Fill Ratio = ((100 + 20 + 200 + 20 + 50 + 100) \*
    1 + (200 + 20 + 200 + 30 + 60 + 120) \* 0.9) / ((10 + 20 + 20 + 30 +
    5 + 8) \* 1 + (15 + 20 + 5 + 5 + 20 + 25) \* 0.4) = 8.19
5.  Account Rate Limits:
    - Account A = max(7.23, 8.19) = 8.19 -> 250 r/s
    - Account B = max(7.91, 8.19) = 8.19 -> 250 r/s
    - Account C = max(10.06, 8.19) = 10.06 -> 300 r/s

### [#](#_5-remarks) 5. Remarks

1.  The release date for the rate limit of perpetual contracts based on fill
    ratio will be announced later. Please stay tuned.
2.  The existing abuse rate limit rules for perpetual contracts will still
    apply, namely:
    1.  Fill Ratio = USDT Training Amount / (Total Number of Order,
        Cancellation, and Modification Requests)
    2.  If the number of requests exceeds 86,400 within 24 hours, with no order
        fill in the same period. Then the order placement rate limit will be
        restricted to 10r/10s for the next hour.
    3.  If the number of requests exceeds 86,400 within 24 hours, with the fill
        ratio below 1%. Then the order placement rate limit will be restricted
        to 20r/10s for the next hour.
3.  Please stay tuned for the fill ratio rate limit for spot trading.

## [#](#return-format) Return Format

All API responses are in JSON format, and users need to transform and extract
data by themselves.

The HTTP status code 2XX will be returned when all operations are successful.
401 indicates that there is a problem with the certification. Other 4xx status
codes indicate that the request is invalid. If it is a 5xx error, the server has
encountered an unknown serious error when processing the request. Please give
feedback as soon as possible.

## [#](#portfolio-margin-account) Portfolio Margin Account

TIP

The Portfolio Margin Account is no longer maintained, please refer to the new
version of the [Unified Account](#unified-account)

Since version `4.25.0`, we start supporting portfolio margin account. Gate's
Portfolio Margin Account is a new feature of Gate's trading system. Its main
function is to break the capital isolation between cross-margin leverage account
and USD cross-margin perpetual contract account inside a Classic Account and
achieve the multi-currency margin sharing among multi-product lines. Thanks to
the margin sharing, users don't need to transfer funds between the two accounts,
and the profit and loss of positions among different trading products can offset
each other and effectively improve the capital utilization rate. See more
details in the
[Help Center](/help/trade/leveraged/26421/introductions-to-gate.io-s-portfolio-margin-account)

Before using the portfolio margin account's API key, you should create the API
key on the API management page. The API key supports spot and perpetual
contracts trading only.

> If permissions of the API key can't be checked, ensure your cross-margin
> account has available balance first.

### [#](#transfer) Transfer

The classic account and portfolio margin account are two different capital
isolation accounts. If you want to achieve multi-currency margin sharing among
multi-product lines, use the portfolio margin account please.

The funds of the portfolio margin account come from the classic account. Due to
the change of funds in the classic account, the transfer of funds can only be
performed using the API Key of the classic account.

The portfolio margin account is upgraded based on the cross-margin account of
the original classic account, so the classic account only needs to transfer its
spot funds to the cross-margin account to deposit the portfolio margin account.
Similarly, withdrawals from portfolio margin account can be achieved by the
classic account performing transferals from the cross margin to its spot
account.

The API Key of the portfolio margin account can only perform transferals among
its own multiple accounts. Due to the sharing of margin, the portfolio margin
account does not need to transfer funds to its futures account (we also restrict
doing so). If the futures account has PNL funds that need to be withdrawn, it
must be transferred by the portfolio margin account's API key to its
cross-margin account first, so that the classic account can perform withdrawals
from portfolio margin account.

### [#](#spot-trading) Spot trading

The spot trading of the portfolio margin account is almost the same as the
classic account, except that `cross_margin` must be specified in the `account`
parameter when placing orders. For example, if you want to place a buy order for
the `BTC_USDT` currency pair, the order request will be similar to

```
POST /spot/orders

{
  "currency_pair": "BTC_USDT",
  "account": "cross_margin",
  "side": "buy",
  ...
}
```

For other related restrictions, please refer to the document of the API endpoint
directly.

TIP

It should be noted that the portfolio margin account is upgraded from the
classic account's cross-margin account. The API Key of the classic account
originally supports the operation of the cross-margin account. In order not to
affect the existing operations of the classic account, we still retain this
function of the classic account. So whether it is the API Key of the classic
account or the portfolio margin account, both can operate the same the cross
margin account (note that the futures accounts are separate)

### [#](#futures-trading) Futures trading

The API operation of the perpetual contract of the portfolio margin account is
exactly the same as that of the classic account, but currently only supports USD
settlement

TIP

In the futures trading, it should be noted that there is no compatibility for
cross-margin accounts like using the API Key of the classic account in spot
trading. Therefore, when using the API Key of the classic account for futures
trading, assets are kept under `classic account-futures`, and when using
portfolio margin account API Key for futures trading, assets are kept under
`portfolio margin account-futures`. These two are different futures accounts. In
addition, funds under `classic account-spot` cannot share margin with
`classic account-futures`.

## [#](#trace-id) Trace ID

The API response will carry the header: X-Gate-Trace-ID . This header is used
for tracking.

## [#](#self-trade-prevention-stp) Self-Trade Prevention (STP)

### [#](#concepts) Concepts

**Self-Trade Prevention**: STP will prevent any user's orders from being matched
with each other.

**CN**: Cancel new, Cancel new orders and keep old ones.

**CO**: Cancel old, Cancel old orders and keep new ones.

**CB**: Cancel both, Both old and new orders will be cancelled.

### [#](#stp-strategies) STP Strategies

We support three STP strategies, which are `CN` , `CO` and `CB`.

STP is achieved by adding users to one STP trading group. When a user in a STP
group place orders, and trading could happen with existing orders of users in
the same group, orders will be cancelled. The prevention strategy depends on the
`stp_act` parameter specified when placing the order as taker. If not specified,
the `CN` strategy will be used by default.

A user has to be added to a STP trading group before using STP. When a user does
not belong to any STP trading group, and place orders with the `stp_act`
parameter, the orders will be rejected.

### [#](#api-parameter-adjustment) API Parameter Adjustment

Take placing futures order as an example:

```
POST /futures/{settle}/orders
```

New request body parameter:

| Name    | Position | Type   | Required | Description                |
| ------- | -------- | ------ | -------- | -------------------------- |
| stp_act | body     | string | No       | STP Strategies, including: |

\- cn  
\- co  
\- cb |

New response fields:

| Name    | Type   | Required | Restriction | Description                |
| ------- | ------ | -------- | ----------- | -------------------------- |
| stp_act | string | No       | none        | STP Strategies, including: |

\- cn  
\- co  
\- cb | | stp_id | integer(int64) | No | readonly | The ID of the STP trading
group to which user belongs. | | finish_as | string | No | readonly | order
finish type:  
\- **stp: The order has been canceled due to the `STP`** |

### [#](#user-case) User case

There are multiple accounts under `Organization A`, and the IDs of several
accounts are `101`, `102`, and `103`

In order to prevent self-trading of orders placed by internal accounts of the
organization, the administrator created a STP trading group with group ID `100`,
and added accounts `101` and `102` to the STP trading group. In this case, the
members in the group are `[101,102]`.

T1: The `STP` strategy version released.

T2: After the `organization A` account `101` places a short order, there is no
matching order in the market order book to match the transaction. At this time,
the role of the order is `maker`, and the order status is `open`. The key
response fields returned are:

```
{
	"status":"open",
	"stp_act":"cn",
	"stp_id":100
}
```

T3: `Organization A` account `101`/`102` places a long order, and it can reach a
trade with account 101’s short order. The match engine finds both two orders'
stp_id are 100, so it applies the STP strategy of the taker order, which
defaults to `cn` , and cancels the long order. Order's `finish_as` will be set
to `stp`. The key response fields returned are:

```
{
	"status":"finished",
	"stp_act":"cn",
	"stp_id":100,
	"finish_as":"stp"
}
```

- If `stp_act` is `co` , the order placed by `taker` will be retained, the order
  status will be `open`, and the system will cancel the order of `maker`.
- If `stp_act` is `cb`, both the long and short orders will be cancelled.
  Orders' `finish_as` will be set to `stp`. The key response fields returned
  are:

```
{
	"status":"finished",
	"stp_act":"cb",
	"stp_id":100,
	"finish_as":"stp"
}
```

T3': If account 103 places a long order, and it can reach a trade with account
101’s short order, the transaction will be made since account 103 has not been
added to account 101’s STP group. The key response fields returned are:

```
{
	"status":"finished",
	"stp_id":0,
	"finish_as":"filled"
}
```

## [#](#unified-account) Unified Account

### [#](#description) Description

Once a user upgrades their account to the unified account, they can utilize the
assets from their spot account as collateral for trading. The assets in the
account, denominated in various currencies, will be adjusted based on their
liquidity and converted to USD for consistent calculation of the account's
assets and position value.

The maximum borrowing limit for margin trading represents the maximum amount
that a user can borrow for a given trading market. The platform calculates the
user's maximum borrowing limit based on factors such as available margin and
platform risk control rules. Once the margin trading generates automatic
borrowing, the platform immediately starts accruing interest on the borrowed
digital assets.

Currently, the ability to switch to `cross_margin` or`usdt_futures` mode is
available. In the future, we will gradually introduce support for various
combination margin accounts, including `Futures`, `Delivery`, `Options` and
more. Stay tuned for further updates.

Please refer to the documentation for unified API. Once you have upgraded your
account, you will be able to make use of these endpoints.

Related endpoint can be found in the Unified Account API doc. After enabling the
Unified Account, you can proceed to call them. For more detailed information,
please refer to [here](https://www.gate.com/unified-trading-account)

### [#](#api-integration-process) API Integration Process

- Create a new `API KEY` or update the permissions of an existing `API KEY`,
  checking the `unified` permission
- Use the classic account's `API KEY` to call the `PUT /unified/unified_mode`
  endpoint, or upgrade from the WEB page to the Unified Account
- Use the `/api/v4/spot/**` API for spot-related operations (ordering, modifying
  orders, querying orders), with the `account=unified` option
- Use the `/api/v4/futures/**` API for perpetual futures-related operations
  (ordering, modifying orders, querying orders)
- Use the `/api/v4/unified/**` API for Unified Account-related operations
  (account querying, loan querying)

### [#](#spot-trading-2) SPOT Trading

The spot trading in the Unified Account is consistent with that in the classical
account. In order operations, specify `account=unified`, or specify
`account=spot` and the system will automatically handle the order as a unified
account order when detecting the account as a unified account. For example, to
place a buy order for the `BTC_USDT` currency pair, the order creation request
would be similar to

```
POST /spot/orders

{
  "currency_pair": "BTC_USDT",
  "account": "unified",
  "side": "buy",
  ...
}
```

For other related restrictions, please refer to the document of the API endpoint
directly.

## [#](#rate-limit-based-on-fill-ratio) Rate Limit Based On Fill Ratio

In order to enhance trading efficiency, we have decided to implement more
favorable sub-account rate limits for clients with a higher fill ratio. This
assessment will be based on trading data from the past seven days and will be
calculated daily at 00:00 UTC. Please note that this rule applies only to
clients at **VIP level 14 and above**.

### [#](#_1-introduction-of-terminology) 1. Introduction of Terminology

#### [#](#_1-1-symbol-multiplier) 1.1 Symbol Multiplier

To facilitate a more refined management of the impact of different trading
products on the fill ratio, we have introduced the concept of the symbol
multiplier. This multiplier allows us to adjust the influence of each product on
the overall trading volume based on its characteristics. For products with a
multiplier of less than 1, they typically involve smaller contract sizes and
therefore require more trading orders to achieve the same trading volume.
Generally, all trading products come with a default multiplier; however, certain
products are assigned independent multipliers based on their specific
characteristics. For detailed information regarding the multipliers of relevant
products, please refer to the provided table.

| Product Typee                    | Based On        | Independnet Symbol Multiplier | Default Symbol Multiplier |
| -------------------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| USDT-Margined Perpetural Futures | Contract Symbol | 1                             |

Contract Symbol:  
BTC-USDT  
ETH-USDT | 0.4 | | Spot | Currency Pairst | 1  
Currency Pairs:  
BTC-USDT  
ETH-USDT | 0.4 |

> Please note: The spot trading rate limits will not be launched this time.

#### [#](#_1-2-definition-of-trading-volume-weight) 1.2 Definition of Trading Volume Weight

We will assess the behavior patterns of makers and takers based on market
fluctuations and design the trading volume weight ratios accordingly.
Additionally, we will regularly evaluate these weights and make synchronized
adjustments when necessary.

**Current weight of the maker trading volume: 100%, current weight of the taker
trading volume: 90%.**

#### [#](#_1-3-calculation-formula) 1.3 Calculation Formula

The system will take a snapshot of the data at 00:00 UTC daily and, based on
this information, will select the higher value between the fill ratio of the
sub-account and the overall fill ratio of the main account to determine the
future trading rate limit for the sub-account. For exchange brokers, the system
will only consider the fill ratio of their sub-accounts. It is important to note
that the main account is also considered a "sub-account."

1.  Sub-account Fill Ratio: This ratio is calculated as follows: (Sub-account
    Taker's USDT trading volume × 0.9 + Maker's USDT trading volume × 1) / (The
    sum of (Number of new and modified requests for each contract × symbol
    multipliers) for each subaccount).
2.  Main-account Aggregated Fill Ratio: This ratio is calculated as follows:
    (main account's Taker USDT trading volume × 0.9 + Maker USDT trading volume
    × 1) / (The sum of (Number of new and modified requests for each contract ×
    symbol multipliers) for all subaccounts).

### [#](#_3-detailed-rules-for-fill-ratio) 3. Detailed Rules for Fill Ratio

1.  Target Client Group: VIP ≥ 14
2.  Calculation Period: 7 days
3.  Update Time: Daily at 08:00 (UTC). The system will update the fill ratio
    data based on the data from 00:00 UTC.
    1.  If the fill ratio and the pre-set rate limit improve, the increase will
        take effect immediately at 08:00 (UTC).
    2.  However, if the fill ratio declines, the rate limit will be reduced
        immediately.
    3.  If a client's VIP level drops below VIP 14, their rate limit will be
        lowered to the minimum tier, taking effect immediately.
    4.  If a client's VIP level rises above VIP 14, their rate limit will be
        adjusted immediately based on their current level.
    5.  If a sub-account's trading volume over the past 7 days is below
        1,000,000 USDT, the rate limit will be implemented based on the
        main-account aggregated fill ratio.
    6.  For newly created sub-accounts, the minimum tier rate limit will be
        applied at the time of creation, and the aforementioned rate limit rules
        will begin to apply at T+1 08:00 (UTC).
    7.  Both WebSocket and REST APIs are subject to these rules.

### [#](#_4-example) 4. Example

Assuming the client has three accounts, with the symbol multipliers for trading
perpetual contract products BTC-USDT and SOL-USDT being 1 and 0.4, respectively.

1.  Account A (Main Account):
    - BTC-USDT perpetual futures Maker trading volume: 100 USDT, number of order
      requests: 10; Perpetual futures Taker trading volume: 200 USDT, number of
      order requests: 20.
    - SOL-USDT perpetual futures Maker trading volume: 20 USDT, number of order
      requests: 15; Perpetual futures Taker trading volume: 20 USDT, number of
      order requests: 20.
    - Sub-account Fill Ratio = ((100 + 20) \* 1 + (200 + 20) \* 0.9) /
      ((10 + 20) \* 1 + (15 + 20) \* 0.4) = 7.23
2.  Account B (Sub-account):
    - BTC-USDT perpetual futures Maker trading volume: 200 USDT, number of order
      requests: 20; Perpetual futures Taker trading volume: 200 USDT, number of
      order requests: 30.
    - SOL-USDT perpetual futures Maker trading volume: 20 USDT, number of order
      requests: 5; Perpetual futures Taker trading volume: 30 USDT, number of
      order requests: 5.
    - Sub-account Fill Ratio = ((200 + 20) \* 1 + (200 + 30) \* 0.9) /
      ((20 + 30) \* 1 + (5 + 5) \* 0.4) = 7.91
3.  Account C (Sub-account):
    - BTC-USDT perpetual futures Maker trading volume: 50 USDT, number of order
      requests: 5; Perpetual futures Taker trading volume: 60 USDT, number of
      order requests: 8.
    - SOL-USDT perpetual futures Maker trading volume: 100 USDT, number of order
      requests: 20; Perpetual futures Taker trading volume: 120 USDT, number of
      order requests: 25.
    - Sub-account Fill Ratio = ((50 + 100) \* 1 + (60 + 120) \* 0.9) /
      ((5 + 8) \* 1 + (20 + 25) \* 0.4) = 10.06
4.  Main Account Aggregated Fill Ratio = ((100 + 20 + 200 + 20 + 50 + 100) \*
    1 + (200 + 20 + 200 + 30 + 60 + 120) \* 0.9) / ((10 + 20 + 20 + 30 +
    5 + 8) \* 1 + (15 + 20 + 5 + 5 + 20 + 25) \* 0.4) = 8.19
5.  Account Rate Limits:
    - Account A = max(7.23, 8.19) = 8.19 -> 250 r/s
    - Account B = max(7.91, 8.19) = 8.19 -> 250 r/s
    - Account C = max(10.06, 8.19) = 10.06 -> 300 r/s

### [#](#_5-remarks) 5. Remarks

1.  The release date for the rate limit of perpetual contracts based on fill
    ratio will be announced later. Please stay tuned.
2.  The existing abuse rate limit rules for perpetual contracts will still
    apply, namely:
    1.  Fill Ratio = USDT Training Amount / (Total Number of Order,
        Cancellation, and Modification Requests)
    2.  If the number of requests exceeds 86,400 within 24 hours, with no order
        fill in the same period. Then the order placement rate limit will be
        restricted to 10r/10s for the next hour.
    3.  If the number of requests exceeds 86,400 within 24 hours, with the fill
        ratio below 1%. Then the order placement rate limit will be restricted
        to 20r/10s for the next hour.
3.  Please stay tuned for the fill ratio rate limit for spot trading.
