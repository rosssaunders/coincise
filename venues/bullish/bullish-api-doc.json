    "description": "# Overview\n\nWelcome to the _Bullish Trading API_ documentation!\n\nThis documentation provides resource descriptions and endpoints usage instructions for the API.\n\nThe API:\n- follows [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) conventions\n- has the base URL `api.exchange.bullish.com` (unless one of the sandbox environments is being used)\n- has endpoints under the below categories:\n  - Authenticated endpoints for private client data e.g. [Get Orders](#get-/v2/orders) endpoint\n  - Non-authenticated endpoints for public data e.g. [Get Markets](#get-/v1/markets) endpoint\n- uses bearer-based authentication\n- enforces a blanket rate limit across all requests\n- may add new fields to existing response payloads. Please do not use strict deserialisation as it may cause compatibility issues.\n\n# Additional Links\n\n- Code examples - [Bullish Github Repository](https://github.com/bullish-exchange)\n- Deprecated features & APIs - [Deprecated Features Documentation](.././deprecated/index.html)\n- Help center - [Bullish Help Center](https://support.bullish.com)\n- Comprehensive guide for new Institutional users - [Institutional User Guide](https://support.bullish.com/hc/en-us/articles/28811587741721-Comprehensive-New-User-Guide-for-Institutions#h_01HPQBYXD72K2M2CRSRXQ5YEWG)\n- Various order/custody status codes - [Error & Rejection Codes](https://github.com/bullish-exchange/api-docs/wiki/Error-&-Rejection-Codes)\n- Operational status of our exchange - [official status page](https://bullish.statuspage.io/)\n\n\n# Connectivity Options\n\nIn GCP, generally our most optimal connection is to operate within asia-southeast1-a Availability Zone. \nPlease note, this may change at any given moment and without warning to another Availability Zone within asia-southeast1 for operational reasons. \nFor AWS or GCP connectivity details, please contact your sales representative\n\n# FIX API\n\nThe FIX API is available to institutional clients and is only accessible through a AWS or GCP private connection:\n- AWS PrivateLink\n  - It provides private connectivity between VPCs, AWS service without exposing your traffic to the public internet. \n  Bullish will provide the published service IDs for this service. You will be able to connect to our FIX service endpoint once the connection has been successfully established.\n- GCP Private Service Connect\n  - It allows customers to access managed services privately from inside their VPC network.\n  Bullish will provide the published service IDs for this service. You will be able to connect to our\n  FIX service endpoint once the connection has been successfully established.\n\n\nFor more details please refer to the full specification:\n- [Bullish FIX Protocol Specification](../../fix-api/Bullish%20FIX%20Protocol%20Specification%20v1.0.13.pdf)\n- [Bullish FIX Protocol Dictionary](../../fix-api/fix-dictionary.xml) \n- [Bullish FIX CRT Certificate](../../fix-api/bullish.crt) \n\n# Exchange Time\n\nAll timestamps are specified in [EPOCH time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time).\n\n# Pagination Support\n\nIf specified in the API documentation, an endpoint may return cursor paginated responses. Default page size is 25.\n\nThere are 4 special query parameters used to control the pagination behaviour.\n- `_pageSize` can be one of `5, 25, 50, 100`, default value is `25`\n- `_metaData` can be false/true, if false the links are NOT part of the response. explicitly set `_metaData=true` to guarantee links are returned.\n- `_nextPage` cursor to the next page. It is provided in the paginated response when `_metaData=true`.\n- `_previousPage` cursor to the previous page. It is provided in the paginated response when `_metaData=true`.\n\nThe paginated data is returned in the following wrapped format with generated links to the previous and next pages:\n```json\n{\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"averageFillPrice\": null,\n      \"baseFee\": \"0.00000000\",\n      \"createdAtDatetime\": \"2018-11-18T00:00:00.000Z\",\n      \"createdAtTimestamp\": \"1639464207402\",\n      \"handle\": null,\n      \"margin\": false,\n      \"orderId\": \"390755652232282113\",\n      \"price\": \"8520.7000\",\n      \"quantity\": \"1.00000000\",\n      \"quantityFilled\": \"0.00000000\",\n      \"quoteAmount\": \"0.0000\",\n      \"quoteFee\": \"0.0003\",\n      \"side\": \"BUY\",\n      \"status\": \"OPEN\",\n      \"statusReason\": \"Open\",\n      \"statusReasonCode\": \"6001\",\n      \"stopPrice\": null,\n      \"symbol\": \"BTCUSD\",\n      \"timeInForce\": \"GTC\",\n      \"type\": \"LMT\"\n    },\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"links\": {\n    \"next\": \"/trading-api/v1/orders?_pageSize=5&symbol=BTCUSD&_nextPage=Mjk3NzM1MzQ5NDI0NjIwMDMy\",\n    \"previous\": \"/trading-api/v1/orders?_pageSize=5&symbol=BTCUSD&_previousPage=Mjk3NzM1Mzg3NzQ3OTc1Njgw\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n# Filtering Support\n\n- If specified in the API documentation, an endpoint may support filters on specific fields and values e.g. `GET /orders?status=OPEN`     \n- Only fields returned in an API response may be used as filter parameters. What you see is what you query on and by.\n- For the fields in the API response usable as filter parameters, please consult the API endpoint of interest.\n- Datetime and timestamp filters require additional keywords from this list - `[ gte, lte, gt, lt ]`. A few examples are provided below.\n  - `/trading-api/v1/trades?createdAtTimestamp[gte]=1686447835000` queries for trades with `createdAtTimestamp` \n    greater than or equal to `1686447835000`.\n  - `/trading-api/v1/trades?createdAtDatetime[gte]=2023-04-06T00:00:00.000Z&createdAtDatetime[lte]=2023-06-07T00:00:00.000Z` \n    queries for trades with `createdAtDatetime` greater than or equal to `2023-04-06T00:00:00.000Z` but less than or equal to `2023-06-07T00:00:00.000Z`\n- By design, pagination query parameters start with an underscore. This differentiates them from filter query parameters e.g. `GET /orders?status=OPEN&_pageSize=25`\n\n# Rate Limits\n\n## Public Endpoints\n\nThe below mentioned public endpoints will be rate limited. For more information please reach out to your Bullish customer support.\n\n- [/trading-api/v1/markets](#get-/v1/markets) and subpaths\n- [/trading-api/v1/market-data](#overview--multi-orderbook-websocket-unauthenticated) and subpaths\n- [/trading-api/v1/history/markets](#get-/v1/history/markets/-symbol-/trades) and subpaths\n- [/trading-api/v1/assets](#get-/v1/assets) and subpaths\n- [/trading-api/v1/index-prices](#get-/v1/index-prices) and subpaths\n- [/trading-api/v1/index-data](#overview--index-data-websocket-unauthenticated) and subpaths\n\n## Private Endpoints\n\nAPI endpoints denoted by `Ratelimited: True` in the description are also subject to rate limits.\ne.g. [Create Order](#post-/v2/orders). The API endpoints fall under the below categories. The rate limit for each category is *independently* applied.\n\n- Unauthenticated endpoints, rate limited at 50 requests per second.\n- Authenticated `/orders` endpoints, rate limited at 50 requests per second.\n- Other Authenticated endpoints, rate limited at 50 requests per second.\n\n### Rate Limits per IP address\n\nEach IP address is subject to a blanket rate limit of 500 requests per 10 seconds (approximately 50 requests per second).\nIf an IP address is rate limited, the http response status code will be `429 Too Many Requests` and the IP address\nis blocked from making any requests for 60 seconds.\n\n### Global Rate Limit\n\nThe global rate limit is an additional rate limit specific to the exchange. It is used to help limit the flow of orders into the exchange. It affects all clients fairly. \nWhen the global rate limit is breached the `x-ratelimit-global-breach` header value will be set to `true` else `false`.\n\n### Rate Limits Info\n\nWhen rate limits are not exceeded, the http response header of the API endpoint called will contain the below:\n- `x-ratelimit-limit`: Maximum number of requests allowed for the specific API category within time period.\n- `x-ratelimit-remaining`: Remaining number of requests allowed for the specific API category within time period.\n- `x-ratelimit-reset`: The next time period in which `x-ratelimit-remaining` is reset back to the maximum allowed for the specific API category.\n- `x-ratelimit-global-breach`: true/false, indicating whether the global limit has been breached.\n\n### Exceeding Rate Limits\nWhen rate limits are exceeded, the API endpoint will return the http response status code `429 Too Many Requests` and the http response body will be:\n```json\n  {\n    \"errorCode\": 96000,\n    \"errorCodeName\": \"RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED\",\n    \"message\": \"Rate limit exceeded\"\n  }\n```\n\n### Exceeding The Global Rate Limit\nWhen the global rate limit is exceeded, the API endpoint will return the http response status code `429 Too Many Requests` and the http response body will be:\n```json\n  {\n    \"errorCode\": 96001,\n    \"errorCodeName\": \"GLOBAL_RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED\",\n    \"message\": \"Global rate limit exceeded\"\n  }\n```\n\n### Increasing Rate Limits\n\nFor more information on increasing your rate limits, please reach out to your sales representative.\n\n### Obtaining Your Rate Limit Token\n\nEach trading account has a unique rate limit token that can be obtained by querying [Get Trading Accounts](#get-/v1/accounts/trading-accounts).\nThe rate limit token must be provided in the HTTP request header `BX-RATELIMIT-TOKEN` to enjoy higher tiers of rate limits \nelse the default of 50 msgs/sec is applied.\n\n# Price And Quantity Precision\n\nA market consists of two assets, namely base asset and quote asset.\nFor instance, the `BTCUSD` market has `BTC` as base asset and `USD` as quote asset.\nThe price of a market is denominated in the quote asset, while the quantity is denominated in the base asset.\nFor instance, the price in `BTCUSD` market is in `USD` while the quantity is in `BTC`. \nEach asset has its own precision. For this, the below asset APIs can be queried.\n\n- The [Get Assets](#get-/v1/assets) API endpoint for all supported asset symbols\n- The [Get Asset By Symbol](#get-/v1/assets/-symbol-) API endpoint for a specific asset symbol\n\nThe precision of an asset is the number of decimal places used to express its value in.\nFor instance, the quantity in the market `BTCUSD` is in BTC. As BTC has a precision of 8, the quantity in `BTCUSD` has 8 decimal places.\nIt follows that in order to express a quantity of 1 BTC in `BTCUSD` market, it has to be `1.00000000` BTC.\n\nAlternatively, the below market APIs can also be queried to obtain the price and quantity precisions for different markets.\n\n- The [Get Markets](#get-/v1/markets) API endpoint for all supported market symbols\n- The [Get Market By Symbol](#get-/v1/markets/-symbol-) API endpoint for a specific market symbol\n\nFollowing the logic outlined above, \n- The precision for quantity is defined by the `basePrecision`\n- The precision for price is defined by `quotePrecision`\n\n\n# Numeric Identifier Contraints\n\nNumeric (i64) identifiers such as `nonce` and `handle` should not have leading zero's. For example `009990822212000000` is invalid but `9990822212000000` is valid.\n\n# Order timeInForce\n\nThe order `timeInForce` can be set to the following values:\n- `GTC` - good until cancelled - the order is open forever unless fully filled or cancelled\n- `FOK` - fill or kill - if the order cannot immediately be filled in full it is cancelled\n- `IOC` - immediate or cancel - the order is immediately filled in full or in part and any remainder is cancelled\n\n# Error & Rejection Codes\n\nDetails of `statusReasonCode` and `statusReason` can be referenced from [Error & Rejection Codes](https://github.com/bullish-exchange/api-docs/wiki/Error-&-Rejection-Codes) \n\n# Authentication\n\nThe API uses bearer based authentication. A JWT token is valid for 24 hours only. To generate a JWT token see - [Generate A JWT Token](#overview--generate-a-jwt-token)\n\n# How To Send Authenticated Requests\n\nTo send an authenticated request, you must follow these steps:\n1. [Generate An API Key](#overview--generate-an-api-key)\n2. [Add Authenticated Request Header](#overview--add-authenticated-request-header)\n3. [Generate A JWT Token](#overview--generate-a-jwt-token)\n4. [Construct The BX-NONCE Header](#overview--construct-the-bx-nonce-header)\n5.

[How do EMS/Brokers Flag Their Executions Sent To Bullish](#overview--how-do-emsbrokers-flag-their-executions-sent-to-bullish)\n\n## Generate An API Key\n\nA prerequisite to generate API keys is to have a Bullish account. To generate an API key follow these steps:\n\n1. Log in into your Bullish account\n2. Click on your account initials at the upper right corner and then click **Settings**\n3. Click **API Keys** and then click **Add API Key**\n4. Select the API Key type, either ECDSA or HMAC\n5. Enter a key name in the *Key Name* field\n6. Adding an IP whitelist is optional. Should an IP whitelist be added, login requests must be from within the IP whitelist range.\n7. Click *Generate API Key*\n\n### HMAC API Key Notes\n\n- A HMAC API Key is a shared secret key that is used for HMAC based signing of trading API requests\n- Always store your HMAC secret in a secure medium as they are used to sign your requests. Do not share your HMAC secret in any publicly accessible areas such as code repositories, client side code, or other vulnerable areas and make sure the keys are not shipped with your mobile or web apps.\n- You do not need the `metadata` string to extract your `userId` like you would a Bullish API Key\n- HMAC API Keys can only be used for Trading on Bullish; the JWT generated using an HMAC API Key is only valid for trading endpoints.\n\n### ECDSA API Key Notes\n\n- An ECDSA API key is a public/private key pair used for ECDSA based signing of trading and custody API requests\n- The private key is what you will use to sign your requests. Always store your private keys in a secure medium as they are used to sign your requests. Do not share your private keys in any publicly accessible areas such as code repositories, client side code, or other vulnerable areas and make sure the keys are not shipped with your mobile or web apps.\n- From here on the:\n  - public key will be referred to as `PUBLIC_KEY`\n  - private key will be referred to as `PRIVATE_KEY`\n- Key and signature format details:\n  - Curve: ECDSA R1 (prime256v1/secp256r1/P-256)\n  - Signature encoding: DER\n  - Hashing Algorithm: SHA256\n  - Key format: X.509 SubjectPublicKeyInfo format, PEM encoded\n\nAn ECDSA API key additionally has a `metadata` string associated with it which is displayed along side the key.\nYou must base64 decode the `metadata` to extract your `userId` (example follows). You will need the `userId` in the next step.\n\n```shell\necho eyJwdWJsaWNLZXkiOiJQVUJfUjFfNWNpVW52TW5rVThMOVBCWnZaa1BGcjhqdkRnUHpzcHhWNGlqOThIN1JqM1FSNzJyMkEiLCJhY2NvdW50SWQiOjIyMjAwMDAwMDAwMDAwNCwiY3JlZGVudGlhbElkIjoiMTAifQ== | base64 --decode\n{\"publicKey\":\"PUB_R1_5ciUnvMnkU8L9PBZvZkPFr8jvDgPzspxV4ij98H7Rj3QR72r2A\",\"userId\":\"12345\",\"accountId\":\"12345\",\"credentialId\":\"10\"}\n```\n\n## Add Authenticated Request Header\n\nEach authenticated request must include a `Authorization` header:\n  - `Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>`\n\nThe JWT is valid for 24 hours.\n\n## Generate a JWT Token\n### Bullish API Key\n#### **`Deprecated`** [[more info](.././deprecated/index.html#overview--bullish-key)]: *Existing Bullish API key will no longer be usable as of `28 June, 2024`*\nTo generate/get a JWT token for a Bullish API Key you will need to perform the following request:\n\n#### POST /trading-api/v2/users/login\n\n- Body\n  - `publicKey` - bullish account public key\n  - `userId` - bullish user id corresponding to the metadata\n  - `signature` - signed JSON string encoding of `loginPayload`, see the code sample for how to get it\n  - `expirationTime` - epoch timestamp in seconds that is 5 minutes in the future\n  - `nonce` - epoch timestamp in seconds; note this login API nonce has no connection to the orders API nonce\n  - `biometricsUsed` - set to `false`\n  - `sessionKey` - set to `null`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"publicKey\": \"<PUBLIC_KEY>\",\n  \"signature\": \"<SIGNATURE>\",\n  \"loginPayload\": {\n    \"userId\": \"100008771\"\n    \"nonce\": 1638776636,\n    \"expirationTime\": 1638776936,\n    \"biometricsUsed\": false,\n    \"sessionKey\": null\n  }\n}\n```\n\n- Response\n\n```json\n{\n  \"authorizer\": \"<AUTHORIZER>\",\n  \"token\": \"<JWT_TOKEN>\"\n}\n```\nSee [generate JWT](https://github.com/bullish-exchange/api-examples/blob/master/session) for sample Python scripts.\n\n### HMAC API Key\nTo generate/get a JWT token for a HMAC API Key you will need to perform the following request:\n\n#### GET /trading-api/v1/users/hmac/login\n\n- Response\n\n```json\n{\n  \"authorizer\": \"<AUTHORIZER>\",\n  \"token\": \"<JWT_TOKEN>\"\n}\n```\n\nYou will need to provide a series of headers along with the request in order to successfully generate a JWT token.\n\n- `BX-TIMESTAMP` - number of milliseconds since EPOCH\n- `BX-NONCE` - client side incremented 64-bit unsigned integer\n- `BX-PUBLIC-KEY` - Public key for the HMAC Key being used to generate the JWT\n- `BX-SIGNATURE` - The signed message related to the login request. Outlined below\n\nTo sign the login request for an HMAC API Key login we will need to construct a string that concatenates the following fields:\n- timestamp - value provided for the `BX-TIMESTAMP` header\n- nonce - value provided for the `BX-NONCE`\n- request method - `GET`\n- request path - `/trading-api/v1/users/hmac/login`\n\nSee [generate JWT](https://github.com/bullish-exchange/api-examples/blob/master/session/generate_jwt_hmac.py) for a sample Python script.\n\n### ECDSA API Key\nTo generate/get a JWT token for a ECDSA API Key you will need to perform the following request:\n\n#### POST /trading-api/v2/users/login\n\n- Body\n  - `publicKey` - ECDSA public key; new line characters should be UNIX encoded (\\n, not \\r\\n or \\r)\n  - `userId` - bullish user id corresponding to the metadata\n  - `signature` - signed JSON string encoding of `loginPayload`, see the code sample for how to get it\n  - `expirationTime` - epoch timestamp in seconds that is 5 minutes in the future\n  - `nonce` - epoch timestamp in seconds; note this login API nonce has no connection to the orders API nonce\n  - `biometricsUsed` - set to `false`\n  - `sessionKey` - set to `null`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"publicKey\": \"<PUBLIC_KEY>\",\n  \"signature\": \"<SIGNATURE>\",\n  \"loginPayload\": {\n    \"userId\": \"100008771\"\n    \"nonce\": 1638776636,\n    \"expirationTime\": 1638776936,\n    \"biometricsUsed\": false,\n    \"sessionKey\": null\n  }\n}\n```\n\n- Response\n\n```json\n{\n  \"authorizer\": \"<AUTHORIZER>\",\n  \"token\": \"<JWT_TOKEN>\"\n}\n```\nSee [generate JWT](https://github.com/bullish-exchange/api-examples/blob/master/session/generate_jwt_ecdsa.py) for a sample Python script.\n\n## Logout using a JWT Token\nUsers can better manage their sessions by logging out of unused sessions. This can be done by calling the `GET /trading-api/v1/users/logout` endpoint with the JWT Token in the header - see [Add Authenticated Request Header](#overview--add-authenticated-request-header).\n\n## Construct The BX-NONCE Header\n\nThe header `BX-NONCE` value is a unique client-side 64-bit unsigned integer. It has the following characteristics:\n\n- Each request the client sends how have incrementing `BX-NONCE` value\n- To prevent a client to send the max value of a 64-bit unsigned integer and thus immediately exhaust all unique nonces\nthe exchange will only accept a nonce within a specified range\n- The lower and upper bounds of the current nonce range are specified by nonce endpoint e.g. `GET /nonce`\n- The nonce range is updated daily\n- The nonce `lowerBound` is the start of day EPOCH timestamp in micro seconds\n- The nonce `upperBound` is the end of day EPOCH timestamp in micro seconds\n\n## Construct The Command You Want To Send\n\nEach authenticated request contains a `<COMMAND>` to be executed by the API.\nA `<COMMAND>` has the following properties:\n\n  - A `<COMMAND>` is JSON encoded\n  - Every field in the JSON payload must have a value. Use `null` to represent the absence of a value\n  - The fields must be specified and encoded in the order presented in this documentation\n\nFind below two `<COMMAND>` examples:\n1. [Create Spot Order](#overview--create-spot-order-example)\n2. [Create Margin Order](#overview--create-margin-order-example)\n2. [Cancel Order](#overview--cancel-order-example)\n\n### Create Spot Order Example\n\nTo create a Spot buy limit order:\n- for the BTCUSD market\n- at a price of `55071.5000`\n- for a quantity of `1.87000000`\n- with a time-in-force of `GTC` (good till cancelled)\n\nThe COMMAND would be constructed like below:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"timestamp\": \"<TIMESTAMP>\",\n  \"nonce\": \"<NONCE>\",\n  \"authorizer\": \"<AUTHORIZER>\",\n  \"command\": {\n    \"commandType\": \"V2CreateOrder\",\n    \"handle\": null,\n    \"symbol\": \"BTCUSD\",\n    \"type\": \"LMT\",\n    \"side\": \"BUY\",\n    \"price\": \"55071.5000\",\n    \"stopPrice\": null,\n    \"quantity\": \"1.87000000\",\n    \"timeInForce\": \"GTC\",\n    \"allowMargin\": false,\n    \"tradingAccountId\": \"111234567890\" \n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Create Margin Order Example\n\nWith reference to the same payload in [Create Spot Order](#overview--create-spot-order-example), setting the field `allowMargin` to `true` will make it a margin order.\n\nDocumentation is available [here](https://github.com/bullish-exchange/api-docs/blob/master/src/trading-api/next/websocket-private-data-update-messages-for-borrowers.pdf) on what happens in the event of liquidation.\n\n### Cancel Order Example\n\nTo cancel a buy limit order:\n- for the BTCUSD market\n- where the `orderId` is `390755251743358977`\n\nThe COMMAND would be constructed like below:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"timestamp\": \"<TIMESTAMP>\",\n  \"nonce\": \"<NONCE>\",\n  \"authorizer\": \"<AUTHORIZER>\"\n  \"command\": {\n    \"commandType\": \"V2CancelOrder\",\n    \"orderId\": \"390755251743358977\",\n    \"handle\": null,\n    \"symbol\": \"BTCUSD\",\n    \"tradingAccountId\": \"111234567890\"\n  }\n}\n```\n### Add Amm instruction \n\n```json\n{\n  \"timestamp\": \"1621490985000\",\n  \"nonce\": \"123456789\",\n  \"authorizer\": \"03E02367E8C900000500000000000000\",\n  \"command\": {\n    \"commandType\": \"V2AddLiquidity\",\n    \"symbol\": \"BTCUSD\",\n    \"baseQuantity\": \"0.00000000\",\n    \"quoteQuantity\": \"0.00000000\",\n    \"upperBound\": \"14000.0000\",\n    \"lowerBound\": \"12000.0000\",\n    \"feeTierId\": \"1\",\n    \"tradingAccountId\": \"111234567890\"\n  }\n}\n```\n### Remove Amm instruction\n```json\n{\n  \"timestamp\": \"<TIMESTAMP>\",\n  \"nonce\": \"<NONCE>\",\n  \"authorizer\": \"<AUTHORIZER>\"\n  \"command\": {\n    \"commandType\": \"V2RemoveLiquidity\",\n    \"liquidityId\": \"557839859386417160\",\n    \"symbol\": \"BTCUSD\",\n    \"tradingAccountId\": \"111234567890\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Command for Transfer Asset \n`POST /trading-api/v1/command?commandType=V1TransferAsset`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"timestamp\": \"<TIMESTAMP>\",\n  \"nonce\": \"<NONCE>\",\n  \"authorizer\": \"<AUTHORIZER>\"\n  \"command\": {\n    \"commandType\": \"V1TransferAsset\",\n    \"assetSymbol\": \"USD\",\n    \"quantity\": \"7.0000\",\n    \"fromTradingAccountId\": \"11123456789\",\n    \"toTradingAccountId\": \"11198765432\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Construct The BX-SIGNATURE Header\n\nThe following signing formats demonstrates how to obtain the `BX-SIGNATURE` header.\n\n## Signing Format\n\nThis signing format works with `/trading-api/v2/orders`, `/trading-api/v2/amm-instructions`, `/trading-api/v2/command` and [Custody](#tag--custody) APIs. \nThis signing format has the following benefits:\n- Null fields need not be included in the HTTP request body\n- Fields need not be strictly ordered in the HTTP request body\n\nConstruct a string that concatenates the following fields:\n- timestamp - value provided for the `BX-TIMESTAMP` header\n- nonce - value provided for the `BX-NONCE`\n- request method - e.g. `POST`\n- request path - e.g. `/trading-api/v2/orders`\n- request JSON string, removing any spaces and newline characters.\n\nNote that the same request JSON string used in signing must be sent as the HTTP request body.\n\n#### How To Sign - ECDSA API Key\n\n1. Hash the above string using a SHA-256 hash function and sign the resulting hexdigest with your ECDSA `<PRIVATE_KEY>`.\n2. DER encode the signature, and base64 encode the DER encoded signature.  \n\nSee [sign a request with ECDSA](https://github.com/bullish-exchange/api-examples/blob/master/orders/create_order_ecdsa.py) for a sample Python script.\n\n#### How To Sign - HMAC API Key\n\n1. Hash the above string using a SHA-256 hash function and take the hexdigest.\n2. Sign the hexdigest from step 2 with your HMAC Secret Key.  \n\nSee [sign a request with HMAC](https://github.com/bullish-exchange/api-examples/blob/master/orders/create_order_hmac.py) for a sample Python script.\n\n## Fetch Trading Account Ids\n\nTrading Account Ids may be required by some endpoints. They can be fetched from [Get All Trading Accounts](#get-/v1/accounts/trading-accounts).\n\nSee an API example [Here](https://github.com/bullish-exchange/api-examples/blob/master/session/get_trading_accounts.py).\n\n## Send The HTTP Authenticated Request\n\nSee [create an order](https://github.com/bullish-exchange/api-examples/blob/master/orders/create_order_hmac.py) for a sample Python script.\n\n## How To Ensure The Order Of *Create Order* or *Cancel Order* Requests\n\nTo ensure the order of the *create order* or *cancel order* requests,\nyou must wait for an acknowledgement response which will contain the `orderId`\ngenerated on the server side.\nAlso remember that the `nonce` parameter, for these two requests, must be a\nunique increasing integer value.\n\nFor example, let us assume the following:\n* You sent 10 *create order* requests in a row without waiting for an `orderId`\n* The `nonce` increases with each request sent and thus\n* The `nonce` is unique for each request\n\nBecause the requests received by the Bullish exchange are processed in parallel\nthe following two possible scenarios can happen:\n* *happy scenario* which has a small chance to occur: all 10 requests are\nprocessed in the exact order sent by the client, no error, all great and you\nare happy\n* *unhappy scenario* which has a higher chance to occur: the requests are not\nprocessed in the exact order sent by you, because the requests might arrive at the\nbullish processing server at different times and thus the validations\nof the `nonce` for each request take place at random times. Because of that all\nthe requests that are validated and have the `nonce` higher than the latest\nvalid `nonce` will be accepted as valid and the ones which have the `nonce`\nsmaller than the last valid `nonce` will be considered invalid and dropped.\nIn the worse case scenario the request with the highest `nonce`, the 10th request\nyou sent, is validated first, and the rest of the 9 requests will fail the\nvalidation because they have the `nonce` smaller than the 10th.\nAlso if some requests are failing because of some other errors, e.g. incorrect\ninputs or internal error, you will not know because you did not wait for the\nacknowledgement from the server side for each request you sent.\n\nIf you wait the acknowledgement from the server side you ensure the order of\nthe requests you sent and you can also verify the status of the order(s) you\ncreated or cancelled.\n\n## How To Enable Out-Of-Order Processing of Order Requests\nThe header `BX-NONCE-WINDOW-ENABLED` is a string representation of a boolean value which enables out-of-order \nprocessing of *Create Order* or *Cancel Order* requests up to a window size of 100 from the highest previously used\n`nonce` value (inclusive).\n\nThe `nonce` parameter is required to be both unique and incremental, but setting `BX-NONCE-WINDOW-ENABLED` to `true` \nloosens this requirement such that the `nonce` is only required to be `unique`. For example, the client is able to \nsend `nonce` values from `1...100` in any order and all the values will be valid.   \n\n## How do EMS/Brokers Flag Their Executions Sent To Bullish\nThe header `BX-REFERRER` value is a unique identifier that can be used by EMS/brokers to flag their executions sent to Bullish.\n\nThis referrer header is applicable to the below mentioned authenticated endpoints:\n  1. [Create Order](#post-/v2/orders)\n  2. [Create OTC Trade](#post-/v2/otc-trades)\n\nFor more details, please reach out to your relationship manager to understand which referrer you are assigned.\n\n# WebSockets\n\nConnection request to the web-socket uses [JWT_COOKIE based authentication](https://github.com/bullish-exchange/api-examples/blob/master/websocket/private_data_web_socket.py).\nTo generate a JWT token see - [Generate A JWT Token](#overview--generate-a-jwt-token). Each web-socket exposes a set of\ntopics that can be subscribed to.\n\n## Servers\n  - `wss://api.exchange.bullish.com` - PRODUCTION\n  - `wss://registered.api.exchange.bullish.com` - PRODUCTION\n  - `wss://prod.access.bullish.com` - PRODUCTION (Direct Connect)\n  - `wss://api.simnext.bullish-test.com` - SANDBOX\n  - `wss://registered.api.simnext.bullish-test.com` - SANDBOX\n  - `wss://simnext.access.bullish.com` - SANDBOX  (Direct Connect)\n\n## Max Open WebSocket Connections\n\nEach WebSocket category has a maximum number of open connections. Once it is reached, new WebSocket requests will be rejected. \nThe WebSocket connections fall under the below categories.\n\n- Unauthenticated WebSockets, maximum of 100 open connections per IP address.\n- Authenticated WebSockets, maximum of 10 open connections per API key.\n\n## Send A Message Over The WebSocket\n\nMessages sent by the client to the server over a web-socket follows the\n[JSON-RPC 2.0 Specification](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification). The server then returns a response following\nthe same JSON-RPC 2.0 format. The `id` field sent by the client will be included in the response, allowing the\nclient to map the server's responses to the messages sent by the client. The client ensures the uniqueness of the\n`id` field.\n\nFind below the message types accepted by the web-socket:\n  1. [Subscription Message](#overview--subscribe-to-a-topic)\n  2.
